the woman in me,unbelievably impressive her torn life on paper,4,im only a third way in shipped lightening fastthe print quality of the book is very good i like the rose and the purple foil they captured her taste here and will look bomb on my bookshelfas for the writing its good amazing no but they painted an incredible picture of her life much better writing than i thought to be honest i was expecting more scattered blurbs throughout the book but the way its presented does honor her experience and sounds like her up to an extent now i do think the ghost writer went verbose in some areas that were unnecessary which derailed her voice in my head but i imagine getting the whole picture would be difficulti was hoping for a thicker book as shes been through a lot so i am a bit disappointed at that but nevertheless its an interesting read thus faras for britneys life story i have to say they were smart in starting with her lineage and she didnt hold back keeping her family accountable from the gate good on her for having convictioni suddenly found myself understanding little quirks connecting the dots certain things would suddenly click in my head for example her british accent and her relationship with a lynchpin matriarch eldervery cool build up laying the ground work for her future decisions by presenting us with complex childhood family dynamics really has me understanding her choices and quirks much better than i ever realized i needed to be deep in thought ofsometimes we judge from a place of pity or outsider perspective instead of compassion now i see the soft gentle feminine side of her mindset that we knew when she was younger start to peek through the pages its that sweet part of her soul that she doesnt show much nowadays for good reason of course as shes been deeply hurt and damaged by others greed but that delicate nature is part of why most of us were charmed by her i hope she finds her way back one dayshes been through a lot and i found myself relating to things shed been through and feeling deeply saddened by her sense of insecurity in childhood her insights correlate along with many of my own life experiences and traumas i was taken aback by her growth in reflection as one would believe anger would be the easy way to portray her story not the case here its her appreciation for her past that has earned my deep respect beyond what i thought i had possessed prior to readingher story with her brother was touching and softened my distain for his participation in the matter of handling her affairs although i hope he is held accountable someday it shows how loving and innocent she was and how grave a loss she has suffered for it is those who are selfless that dont speak up only to suffer the mostsuch a contrast to the presentation of her character in the media thus far this book is an excellent read to be continued im looking forward to reading through this book in its entirety and will update when im done one star for the writing not sounding like her in some places i will change accordingly,positive
the woman in me,what a heartbreaking story,5,there have been so many times when i was scared to speak up because i was afraid somebody would think i was crazy but ive learned that lesson now the hard way you have to speak the thing that youre feeling even if it scares you you have to tell your story you have to raise your voicewhat a heartbreaking story whatever you feel about britney this memoir makes you understand and have empathy for all the things that have made headlines in her life it took me a little bit to get into it because though people believed this was going to be ghostwritten i believe the editors tried to keep it raw and in her voice so it does jump around a little bit and the flow can be off but it feels authentically britney i got to a point where i couldnt put it downand then there were parts i had to put it down because it was very difficult to read what she went throughi dont think i will look at any of her past interviews or performances the same and i wish her the bestin speaking of when her family forced her into a mental health facility after refusing to do a second tour in vegas and wanting to change up dance moves in a performancegod must have been with me through that period of time three months into my confinement i started to believe that my little heart whatever made me britney was no longer inside my body anymore something bigger must have been carrying me through because it was too much for me to bear alone i look at the fact that i survived and i think that wasnt me that was god,positive
the woman in me,britney you are so invincible you are an inspiration and helped motivate me to be strong like you,5,the media could not be loaded i personally have been in the same exact situations as some of these in britneys memoir my sons father illegally withheld my son from me for days when i have primary physical custody and sole legal custody the police wont take a child from a parents care regardless of court order the court system is a joke and didnt help at all i am an unemployed single mother so i didnt have a lawyer and no one in my family would help me because my parents dont have that kind of money and my nana and pop passed away all i have it wasnt until i filed an emergency hearing after all my other petitions were denied to finally be seen at court to get my son back the father even then refused so eventually after educating myself online for days and countless hours of research i made a petition asking the judge for police to use force as necessary to ensure i get my son back this time a little more than a week later the judge granted it the pain emotional turmoil absolute defeat despair depression anxiety grief guilt helplessness and being put down by everyone you thought was family and loved you i didnt do anything wrong either i had my son with no help from anyone his whole years of life working side jobs taking care of an old woman and cleaning dirty toilets to provide what he needed those sleepless nights crying wondering why this happened what your child is thinking or being told if he thinks he was abandoned when youre showing up with police escorts and every day fighting to get your child back but your son doesnt know that in my situation that whole petty situation was over my jealous sister trying to get me kicked out to take my room master bedroom my sons bedroom and a master bathroom i spent renovating old neglected house and the father not wanting to pay child support so they ganged up on us to be vindictive at the stake of my sons emotional and mental wellbeing every two weeks only visits dad days a month depending on how many weeks are in the month people are cruel you are only as good as you are giving once your hand closes you will have no one my son is still struggling months later with the emotional turmoil from the trauma they caused him hes having outbursts in school because of the trauma i still am also traumatized every time his visitation at his father comes i worry ill never see my child again and yes sometimes it makes me want to hide him too for anyone to judge you and your choices when you were literally helpless walking through the gates of hell and trembling with every step taking every single low blow and still not giving up doing it all alone no help evil experiences almost always revolve around money and evil people you are invincible no one will ever understand until they walk in those shoes dont you ever underestimate your resilience and strength you are strong you are amazing you are beautiful you can do it what those people did to you that were supposed to love you but instead used you to profit off your hard work prosperity and dedication i hope karma comes for them hard i can not imagine the trauma you have been through especially living under a microscope with hundreds of dangerous paparazzi men hungry for money and seeing your grief and pain profiting off your downfall when you were on top of the world chasing you and your children around with such disrespect and disregard to how that would affect your children and your emotional and mental health is disgusting you were put in fight or flight mode given ptsd betrayed and locked up like a prisoner while everyone took all of your money you worked hard for building your empire for the family you always dreamed of creating please stay strong and keep fighting for your happiness you deserve to live the life of your wildest dreams you deserve to be the happy woman that got to enjoy doing what she loved you deserve to do what you want when you want you are worth it you know who you are what youve done and what you are capable of now pick up that crown queen of pop scream you wont give up and win,positive
the woman in me,fast read sad story,5,i have been a fan of britneys music since the s she is just a couple years older than me i didnt love how she dressed or how sexy she was on the tv screen because i felt like i was expected to look and act just like her at the time she definitely influenced fashion and hair and young womens actions however that is not entirely her faultthe paparazzi was insane around her there were so many tabloids and photos taken of her throughout the years that by the time i reached age or i refused to purchase or even pick up a magazine while standing at the store checkout in solidarity with britney what they did to her was disgusting invasive and abusive it makes my skin crawl just thinking about itbut her music was fire the mixture of dub step rhythms with her music was so fun and energetic i still listen to it from time to time and dancethe book was written pretty simply you can see that she has done some therapy and has gained some insight into her life her history she is trying to understand why she did the things she did and why she trusted those she trusted the kinds of betrayals she has endured in the past two decades will need some serious cbt to rewrite those neuropathways into a healthier train of thoughtour society is still learning what entails abuse and what does not ive definitely felt my share of emotional and psychological abuse it hangs inside of your thoughts long after youve stopped being around those people you must be constantly diligent to stop those negative thoughts toward yourself and to rewrite what your mind says to you you hear what your mind tells you way more often than you hear negative words from others you are with you of the time theres nowhere to run so you need to become your own best friendi hope this book was written by her and that she is receiving the payments from purchases i hope that she wrote it and it was done with her consent i find the timing of the release of this book crucial but maybe if i was released from prison i would run to publish my side of the story too i would have probably been writing in journals the entire timei hope she heals she seems to be on her way i hope she simplifies her life and stops letting outsiders inside of her mind the book was easy to read doesnt get too deep into her psyche it is very surface level she is telling her story its not super deep or introspective or thought provoking in any particular way i am definitely confused as to why the conservatorship was done in the first place and then held for years but i was already informed about that before the book i read the book in and hoursmany times i wished that she would tell more details of one story or other but so much of her life has been an invasion of privacy that i understand maybe she doesnt want to allow more than just the surface level story out there its her choice,positive
the woman in me,buy it its worth the read,5,whether or not youre a fan its a great read britney takes you in her world and shares her perspective of how hateful the tabloid tv hosts and paparazzi was and still is to her the vile hateful ignorant comments towards her that people got away with in the s is incomprehensible really all the while she stood tall taking every blow and silently suffered through it she was always perceived as dumb but i never thought that she carried herself with dignity and gave everyone respect even if they didnt reciprocate it from what ive gathered by reading her words she didnt have a enough people in her corner looking out for her the struggles she shared about motherhood i felt so connected to its difficult enough experiencing it in the comfort of your own home with people who love you and care about you but to experience that all while the world was watching and scrutinizing everything you do seems agonizing society still sets impossible standards for women and mothers but men can do something as simple as take their kids to school and be sung as heroes the judgment you feel amongst your own community of fellow parents is hard and can really make you second guess yourself as a parent but on the scale of a celebrity it seems impossible to do any good or anything right i cant ever imagine putting my kid through any of the horrible experiences her own family put her through but not everyone is fit to be a parent and from what ive read her parents fit that mold very well overall it is an exceptionally well written book and full of quirky humor that sheds a warm light on the britney i grew up watching loving and admiring her strength and grit is unmatched i hope this gives her solace and she thrives from this point on to find herself,positive
the woman in me,a mustread for anyone whos seeking freedom or overcoming imposter syndrome,5,i had to finish the book in a week because i needed breaks although its a quickread it reads lyrical like her music very catchy and vivid its dark like the color of the coverif everything stated in the memoir is true shouldnt her father and his posse be arrested or at least sued for fraud or abuseis it just me or do her parents resemble jefferey epstein and ghislane maxwell who kept britney as a sex slave for years just to use her body to create cash flowwhy is it when shes flying solo the families fell apart parents divorced sister tried to disown them and when shes under conservatorship her family got reunited parents got back together watching criminal minds every night and sister and father bondedwhen she became an icon she became a thing people would judge or vent on she never had a life and because of that her growth or womanhood was stunted she talked about what meant everything to her music family sons its saddening to learn that in the end the simple desires of having everything almost killed her it became worse when she had no one to help or maybe people were just preoccupied with their own struggles as alwaysamong her ordeal she noted people she drew inspirations from madonna jlo reese witherspoon and the woman in her that had been suppressed for decadesthats what happened not fair and horrific her kind soul and eager for happiness eventually set her free from imprisonment hope she will make up and catch up with life,positive
the woman in me,our queen has spoken,5,the world has had access to britney spears memoir for one week and bookstagram is flooded with opinions and reviews but since this is the latest kayce star i have to tell you why and leave you my full reviewive been a britney fan since day one and have seen the relentless paparazzi coverage of her for years everyone has an opinion on britney judge her and think they know everything based on what theyve seen in magazines and online finally speaking for herself this memoir tells us about all those stories we think we knew but from her perspectivewhile the memes and reels about justin are pretty funny since this came out britney went through a very traumatic experience with him you know the one and our girl held that in for twenty years and why wouldnt she thats an incredibly personal decision and all the while the media villainized her and praised him i really dont care what justin thinks about britneys revelations he made his choices then and shes making her choices now never once does she victimize herself but simply tells us how she felt through all the ups and downs personally and professionallyyou get fun stories too about her favorite album favorite performances celebs she admires and more britney admits she is not good at fame girl we know and none of us would be either if britney never gets on another stage for the rest of her life i wouldnt blame her for one second but given how healing music is for her i wouldnt be surprised if we got more music one day and if its on her terms i bet it will be the best shes ever releasedsince the woman in me is just pages i thought it would feel short and unfinished but she did a great job recapping up to present day shes so brave and stronger than she realizes and her love for her sons is on every page cheers to britney may she continue to heal and surround herself with people who love her and dont want to use or exploit her she still has her beautiful heart despite everything and i think thats a huge testament to her strengthhighly recommend my besties memoir stars,positive
the woman in me,beyond the content lies the conversation,5,i absolutely adored every minute of this audiobook while the stories are heartwrenching and even somewhat uncomfortable to hear you have to admire the sheer amount of bravery and fortitude it took for britney to finally sit down and tell her side of the story is it the as a court would say the whole truth and nothing but the truth well never know because we are the outside spectators to these stories many of which were only hearing for the first time many of the stories that are contained within these pages are so steeped in lore and speculation that discerning the actual truth would be about as likely as proving the existence of god or coming up with a satisfactory solution to the abortion issue what is true about this book however is that its existence will allow for a bigger conversation to take place not just around the issues of mental health but of the sensationalization of media coverage the brutal realities of being a windup doll for public consumption and the ethics of a mental health conservatorship i applaud britney as well as michelle williams for both bringing this book and these stories to both light and life i recommend that anyone who has ever been curious about britneys life or any of the other concepts ive mentioned read this book immediately and often,positive
the woman in me,in her words heartbreaking and hopeful,5,her life and story told in her words britney spears has had an expansive career and her face has been splattered on many covers of magazines accompanied by stories that photos and showed whatever it took to make those people rich they were never telling her storybritney tells the story of her life with raw honesty she speaks of happiness joy sadness trauma love rejection rumors heartache and being used by so many people around her people who should have loved protected and guided her her early days when she truly felt joy in the music and dance how that became an escape for her she talks about her love life setting records straight there is no fingerpointing or blame just the truth about who she loved how she loved and her dreams for lifeshe talks about her boys in a way that all mothers can relate to her desperation to just be able to see them to be able to be with them how they were used as a weapon used to get her to perform her experiences with the paparazzi how relentless and cruel they were as a mother i cant imagine what i would have done especially with newborns and having ppdshe speaks about the conservatorship she shares the horrible things her father put her through the fear she asks over and over again why am i under this conservatorship yet i am still working making money supporting people why was she a woman who wasnt able to make the simplest of choices for herself for her bodythis memoir is a quick read it isnt hollywood gossip it is a story of a woman who is moving on in her faith a survivori pray she finds the peace that she truly seeks,positive
the woman in me,britney do not stop being you,5,i bought the book thinking it would arrive before i left for vacation it didnt so i bought the audiobook as welli listened to the audiobook nonstop i felt every little bit of feeling listening to michelle williams read britneys memoir britneys life is poignant utterly devastating and full of love and hope all at the same time ive been a britney fan since baby one more time her music brings about feelings of nostalgia from my youth and she reminds me of everything good from that time in the early s i saw and read in the media back then how britney was portrayed and how relentlessly the paps chased her like britney said like she wasnt human it was a daily thing and i felt so devastated for britney people criticized her destroyed her image all that ahhh i cried listening to this memoir i have nothing but respect and love for britney she is one strong woman for coming out in one piece after what her father and the rest of her family did to her you can feel how much britney loves her boys and as a parent myself i would do anything for my kids just as she britney you are an inspiration for strength resilience love and hope girl do not stop being you i love you and i will and the rest of your loyal fans will have your back no matter what,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,not really a kiss and tell but maybe a drug and tell,4,ill admit i rarely watched friends when episodes first aired my wife started binge watching it a couple years ago or so probably during the pandemic and so i started watching it with her i do think that i was a little too hard on the show though as i always thought that it was a bit of a seinfeld ripoff in reality there are enough differences in the shows that now after watching the entire series of each ive relaxed my criticism a bitand i rarely read autobiographies or what people usually call memoirs nowadays i usually am reading truecrime books in particular those about serial killers i did read cmon get happy fear and loathing on the partridge family bus cgh from david cassidy in and i actually liked mr cassidy less after reading his memoir i kind of wish i wouldnt have read cgh and just remembered him instead from his time on the show its just that i found mr cassidy to be a bit of a braggart while reading and while i finished cgh i was struggling to even care towards the end im guessing that susan dey felt the same ahemnow rarely does matthew perry brag during friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir flb about himself he does discuss how much money he made during filming of friends and i dont have a problem with that mostly because he discusses how david schwimmer actually was instrumental in negotiating a great deal for the entire cast and not just for mr schwimmer in reality mr perry is far more selfdeprecating in flb than mr cassidy is in cgh mr perry doesnt seem to hide much when it comes to his struggles with addiction and if he does underplay it well he must be really bad mr perry discusses how he was taking up to pain killers a day and that is extreme for those who dont know pain killers tend to dry you out and slow down digestion so i have no idea how someone could take that many for any length of time and survivewell mr perry almost didnt survivemr perry was rushed by a friend from one of his many stints in rehab to the hospital and the people running the rehab facility tried to stop him if they had been successful mr perry surely wouldve died heck he still shouldve died in the hospital even though he had probably the best care that money could buy from memory he said that only two percent of people survive on the machine required to keep him alive and i think he also called it a hail maryoverall i really liked flb and i actually read it in one day as a matter of fact i couldnt sleep last night and kept picking up my kindle device and would continue reading usually readers might say i couldnt put it down but i might say i couldnt leave it down over and over i picked up my device opened the kindle app and continued from my last bookmark luckily for me kindle apps save the bookmark for me and thats only one of the reasons i tend to almost only read digital i will buy a paperback or a hardcover version but only if i must read a book and there is no digital versionbut still flb is not a perfect book far from it towards the end i think that mr perry starts to repeat himself and i got the feeling that he was on a tight deadline and just hammered out the last few chapters i dont know if he first created an outline i think that all authors should do so at an early phase in writing but i think a good outline wouldve really helped create a more polished effort its also the case that mr perry has a tendency to use too many parentheticals and that becomes a bit of a distraction for the readernot that it bothers me but it might bother some readers mr perry does discuss religion or at least god quite a bit towards the end if religion is a turnoff i think that flb may not be for you mr perry does seem to think that god helped keep him alive maybe even helped him break some addictions and that is fine by me i cant prove it either way and it is mr perrys memoir so he has a right to think and write whatever he chooses personally i appreciate his honestymr perry does admit going into open houses and swiping pain meds from home sellers and that reminded me a lot of ryan leaf i think that mr leaf used to do the same thing and it got that exnfl player quite a few years in prison for it from a legal standpoint if i were mr perry and i were writing a memoir i think i might not have disclosed this i am not a lawyer and i dont know what legal troubles it could cause him nowthere has been quite a bit of noise about how mr perry tends to kiss and tell and i think thats overblown a bit he does discuss how he and valerie bertinelli made out within just a few feet of eddie van halen after mr van halen had passed out from drinking too much wine hey i guess ive been there myself so i wont judge um from mr van halens perspective and not necessarily from mr perrys but mr perry doesnt really dwell on it too much i can understand how ms bertinelli feels about the disclosure although of course mr van halen is no longer with us if mr van halen were still alive i believe that mr perry probably wouldnt even bring it up just a guesswell if youre a fan of friends and matthew perry and you like to read memoirs ill give a fairly strong recommendation for friends lovers and the big terrible thing if you dont fit that criteria perhaps you might want to read something else but if youre a fan of david cassidy from the partridge family ill recommend you pass on his memoir sometimes its better to only remember the good things about your heroes after all,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,an absolute rollercoaster,4,i purchased matthew perrys book last year when it was published and have had it on my list of books to read i finally read it yesterday in one sitting wow i have never written a book review on amazon but after i finished reading i felt compelled to leave a review i knew he had a serious drug habit but had no idea the extent of his addiction it was difficult to read parts of the book but i could not put it down i have watched friends for years and still watch the reruns and it was always obvious to me how much his physical appearance was affected by his drug and alcohol use having family members with this disease i found the book actually exhausting to read just when i thought it could not get worse it did i think it is so sad that he had such a tormented life right from the beginning and he was never truly able to enjoy his success i was so sad to hear of his passing at such a relatively young age but not really surprised even though his cause of death has not yet been determined after reading this brutally honest memoir i find it surprising that he lived as long as he did i was shocked to learn the extent of abuse his body endured its not the same watching friends now knowing hes gone and knowing what he went through while on the show rest in peace matthew thanks for all the laughs,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,i hope you read this book,5,i just finished mathews book i did not realize until i was almost done with his story that it could have been my fathers story accept my father died after getting septic from colon cancer surgery he too had a fistula and they gave him liquids which spilled out and killed him dad drank smoked and took all the same drugs mathew did my dad rejected aa because of step two my dad had an irrational fear of insanity my father saw shrinks and they gave him drugs to treat the fear and anxiety my dad had seven children with four different woman and many woman on the side mathew my dad and myself were abandoned at a critical time when we were vulnerable children i think my dad mathew and i were and are driven by the desire to have that feeling of safety and comfort we lost early in life if it ever really existed maybe we are trying to find that feeling of safety and comfort we imagine only exists for others i also believe that that feeling in the gut of anxiety and fear can be about a screwed up digestive track made worse by relationships drugs alcohol and cigarettes relationships drugs alcohol and cigarettes cause and treat the discomfort of fear and anxiety these substances and behaviors seem to bring relief but only for a moment and then they make it worse i think the absence of depression and anxiety can be from the absence of an irritable bowel and peace of mind mathew was born with colic his stomach was a problem from the startthis is a list of some of the substances he usedconstant crying from colic mathew was drugged withphenobarbital so his parents could sleepdilaudidsuboxonevaliumxanaxat one point he was addicted to six milligrams of ativan a dayboozeoxy is what blew up mathews colon the warm honey feeling he describes from the oxy paralyzes the gut bringing on depression and anxiety at one point mathew did sixty pills a day my dad suffered from oxy i experienced it tooall this stuff impacts mood depression fear anxiety fear of depression anxiety and fear the same feelings of abandonment fear and anxiety a small child feels i felt when i became aware i was abandoned these feelings are alive and well in mathews and my body and they can be triggered by something happening good or bad i dont like to leave my house because just pulling out of my driveway is stressfulafter reading the book i can better understand myself and my dad i was not present for my life and i mistreated the people i love while seeking relief from my addictiondiscomfort i even became codependent in recovery by trying to replace the substances with gurus i too had the spiritual experience that made me feel completely loved and free from my insanity it lasted until i tried to talk about it with other people who did not get it i was distracted by their lack of appreciation for what i was sayingafter reading this book i feel like i have been in rehab for a week i see my disease better mathew perry lived the unbelievable nightmare of mental illness and lived to tell about it we focus on the substance when that substance is really just an attempt to treat the real problem is selfawareness of the core issue enough to free oneself from the intolerable agony of having paralyzing feelings of being discarded and fearing it will happen again and again even if only just by the president of the pta isolation is the only way i knew to protect myself from fulfilling the prophecy my sister made to me she said i would never have any friends i was eight years old she was nine i believed her i was all alone on rancho drive i had no friends not even my sister just the word friends can trigger my discomfort no matter how many people i call friend i can not dispel that belief the big secret i carry is i believe i have no value when people treat me as though i have no value i want to die mathew said it annihilated him to be left annihilated describes the feeling i want to avoid the most until now i could not think of a word strong enough to convey my discomfort annihilation feels right sadly whenever i risked talking about this belief i was told to get over it that would be fine accept it is who i think i am can i just get over itwhat or how would i know if i were over iti want god to always be there for me now whenever i clear my channel to feel his awesomenessi hope you read the book,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,brutally honest,4,i was a fan of matthew perry from the beginning of friends he truly had such great comedic timing and he brought such life to every part he played i had always known he had suffered from addiction and had been in rehab several times but i never realized just how horrible his addiction was and for how many years he fought iti was so saddened to hear of his death earlier this week i hope he continued to be sober and enjoy life as he stated he was at the end of this book its so sad that someone that had seemingly all their dreams come true starred in a once in a lifetime show and was so accomplished was also so miserable during all of it that he never enjoyed it he was a great talent and will be missed,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,the one with the double review,3,so i will review this as two people a writer and masters of writing student and as a fan of matthew perryhey matthewso we know you can write at least i knew you did after i had read interviews on mr sunshine a bunch of years back you wrote a sitcom so i knew you could probably put words together i am glad i read this as someone who is currently reading for a degree we have been taught to analyze something i just do now no matter what i read and this one was interesting it began well enough and your words were put together nicely i usually like it when we move back in forth time but in this instance it was little too much especially considering we changed places so often california to new mexico to switzerland to new york it was time and place jumping which in writing you have to do very carefully what bothers me is editors should have picked this up there should have been better breaks between timeplace changes and or labels you could have been very creative here like using the friends way of labeling the one where my colon explodes or the one where i tried to get sober in switzerland i wish i could have been an editor on this book it would have made a little more sense youre supposed to write with the audience in mind and i dont know if this is what happened seemed like it was more of a therapy assignment for you but what do i know i once got into a fight without taking my hoops out sometimes i dont know jackthe thing with memoirs is that you cant write this in a way that constitutes a running thought because were getting real facts with dates as it turns out the two most important things in the book and why we wanted to read about your life were a little too muddy to always keep straight if you have to reread to understand something multiple times it becomes less and less fun to read running thoughts are great when you talk about the hook ups and minute details but the structure was missing for the meat and potatoes ya dig i write fiction but we can also use the same ideology that we do use there that there are rules even within nonfiction writing that things can be said too much and all at once we want to know how matty can i call you that talks about addiction the horrors of addiction are real and true and any addict knows this but there should have been editing paging an editor a little more of an even grading downwards jumping off preverbal nonfiction cliffs is never fun its like jumping from the snow to the hot tubim not sure why people are shocked that you talk about sex either youre a nicelooking guy on tv with boatloads of cash of course you got laid of course women throw themselves at you and of course you were emotionally unavailable if i have learned anything from this book was that you werent lying when you said in fact that you were chandler but i get peoples points i mean we got the assignment that you were a horny tv star and then we just kept on getting it redundancy shes a we want to get a point across but then whats too muchas a fan of yours comedy in general i dont think its ever a good idea to read too much about people you admire from afar i will never know you and you will never talk to me in my life so this book is all i have to go by yes you were selfish you call yourself that several times but one thing that surprised me most is when you spoke on how you would trade the money and the fame with your friend living in the rentcontrolled apartment living with diabetes considering how much you spent on treatments and literally paying people to help you get clean you had resources most addicts will ever see a th of while you say youre grateful in the book and i know youre trying to get the point across that fame doesnt fix you there are millions of people that would give their left um thing to be in your shoes with access to switzerland hot nurses and new teeth i cant even afford one implant there is a reality missing from this that doesnt quite touch the rentcontrolled tenant this is coming more from the side of overcelebrity that most of us will never even remotely see that chasm is large and your perspectives after thirty years of fame are so far on the side of hollywood that not having money seems better its not money wont fix everything but it eases burdens ask me what my husband and i argue most aboutthe title of this book should be the one where the grass is always greenermatthew write another book i would love to see a comedic novel from you based loosely on your life you would get to use the words based on a true story you can write i saw that and while you have spent your life chasing other peoples opinions and mine shouldnt matter consider it there is so much untapped creativity there that it makes me crazy be grateful you have the platform you do and youre not a mom stuck in the burbs like me oh and call craig and maybe pay for his diabetes medicationthats all i have i thank you for opening yourself up and spilling the ugly out thats never easy sorry for the honestly but then no one care what i think anywaysbe well bingalingps does yemen have a nice view,neutral
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,raw and real,5,it is no secret that i am a huge friends fan so when matthew perry died last week i decided to open up his book i have had it since it came out just have not read it i havent been able to bring myself to watch an episode of friends since his death friends is an escape for me and its not easy to escape when theres such a great sadness right now this book is raw what he went through with drugs and alcohol was so incredibly difficult but the other thing that really took me by surprise was how raw he is about his relationship with god i so appreciate that he included that in his book i get so used to reading books by christian authors where everything is just wonderful but his rawness about his struggles has really helped me to find a peace with his death definitely a reread,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,wow,5,i wasnt going to read this book having seen previous reviews which mentioned it was heavy and dark not really my thing but then perry passed away and i couldnt not pick up this book and i think previous to his passing i wouldnt have found this book to be too heavy or dark i think it shines light and hope on a tough topic it made me really see something i had no idea was there it was riveting and interesting and it ended with such hope hope which has been crushed with this most recent news and with that comes crushing sadness instead of hope i just feel bad for him all those hopes and dreams he had for himself all that fighting and for what i have no doubt he has helped and will continue to help many people with his comedy his words his story i just feel deep sadness that he didnt get the chance to find his own hea,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,a very sad read,4,what a shock to lose such a talented and funny actor so young i know when this memoir first came out a lot of people had a lot of not very nice things to say about matthew perry but i think they didnt get it this man had severe childhood trauma and abandonment issues that he never processed and he was a drug addict he really bares his soul here in this book i have always loved matthew perry and i was still love him even after reading his memoir im so sad that he never was able to permanently beat his demons he was a talented and funny actor and not just in friendsi hope he is resting peacefully now after years of no sleep here is hoping the eternal one also comes with an amazing view where he can see how much the world really did love him,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,i had no idea,5,i am not a celebrity memoir reading type person i happened to watch an interview he did last year with a canadian station maybe bbc and truly had no idea that matthew perry was an alcoholic or drug addict i decided to get the book and finished it in sitting it is well written and an easy read i think people forget that celebrities are human too it was a rough ride for matthew perry but i am glad he was able to face his demons become clean and sober before his untimely passing rip matthew perry,positive
friends lovers and the big terrible thing a memoir,bittersweet,5,im so glad i read this or i would never have known the multilayered life of matthew perry i learned so much about drug and alcohol addiction and how it affects ones body mind soul and spirit i wish hed never entered the world of horrors and wish hed been able to experience true peace and joy sooner i will always love and miss matty and am sad to have lost him so young he never married or had children and he would have been such a fantastic father if he had beat his addictions long ago rip matty,positive

fourth wing the empyrean,stars,4,one sunday i was visiting blogs which i dont get to do very often and stumbled upon one that caught my eye i cant remember the exact wording but the blogger stated they didnt enjoy a book that was getting a ton of buzz and love however she worded her comments piqued my interest so i looked up the book on goodreads and decided almost instantly that it sounded like something i would like i added it to my wish list and husband bought it for me for my birthday i still put off reading it for a while because i needed to focus on review books first i finally found time to pick it up and i have to say that i didnt want to put fourth wing down we never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch tv all day but husband wasnt feeling well it was degrees outside and i was enthralled so i read every chance i got that first day and read about by midnight i needed to sleep because i knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me and i finished the other the next dayfourth wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series you have a flawed leading characterviolet is fragile her bones break easily her joints and ligaments are weak as well she is short and generally not physically strong she is however brilliantly intelligent she spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant but her mother one of the nations top military leaders decrees that violet will enter the dragon riders quadrant insteadthe riders quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive often times the tests kill the cadets just as often the other cadets will do the killing and what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves unique schools like this are why series like harry potter vampire academy divergent red rising and even throne of glass have been wildly popular and universally lovedand i mean dragons the appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating perhaps because theyre imaginary we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media fourth wings dragons are some of the best ive come across from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans plus the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders these dragons are so well done i applaud rebecca yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to lifethe friends are an interesting variety as well there are friendships that form almost instantly those that have spanned entire lifetimes those that form unexpectedly and even ones that form begrudgingly the personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders violets older sister mira warns her against forming friendships in the riders quadrant allies are important but friendship can often be a liability plus when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa but violet doesnt survive the riders quadrant by following the path others have established she must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trialsspeaking of abilities rebecca yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters none of the signets were too similar to each other and i loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet she even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talentsthe enemies were fierce we start off with violet being warned by her sister mira to steer clear of xaden riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the kings justice for his fathers rebellion violet meets him almost immediately nearly the same time a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links only violet embarrasses the new cadet and he swears revenge that he will kill her and hes not the only person she ticks off during her first year xaden is hard to read he forces violet into his wing since hes a wingleader he bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive ignoring her completely and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against herof course the driving questions are about whether violet will survive each challenge shes faced with if she does will a dragon want to bond with her at least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions and then you want to know what will happen next i cant reveal those questions to you as theyd be spoilersfavorite quotesthey choose for reasons they dont see fit to share with us he pushes off his desk and not all strength is physical violetyou are not attracted to toxic men i remind myselfi had to laugh at that oneone does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes upjustice is not always mercifuli know you just want to keep me safei whisper but keeping me safe is also keeping me from growing tooi will hate you for this yeah he nods a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away i can live with thatandarna is my favoriteyou can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones wingleaderwhatever you feel is natural allow yourself to feel it but then let it goif we let fear kill whatever this is between us then we dont deserve itone generation to change the text one generation to choose to teach that text the next grows and the lie becomes historyi was so disheartened when i finished fourth wing and went to go purchase iron flame only to find that it wasnt released yet the unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive the friends the enemies the romance the dragons all of it was exactly what i look for in a series now i will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government things have the potential to go south like series such as divergent and the hunger games we shall see if the empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like red rising and throne of glass that being said fourth wing gets stars have you read fourth wing what did you think let me know,positive

fourth wing the empyrean,amazing best book of,5,i have nothing but good things to say about this book buckle upim honestly not even sure that i will be able to gather my thoughts and form a coherent review to adequate explain how much i adored this book but im going to try lets start by saying that i am obsessed with this bookthis was outstanding and amazing in every single way i cried i laughed i giggled i gasped i did all the things i have not felt so many things while reading a book since my last sjm read fourth wing absolutely deserves all the hype and more if the hunger games divergent harry potter and game of thrones had a baby this would be itthis book was the perfect mixture of romance and high stakes and the vibes were so spot on fourth wing is fast paced from beginning to end and will absolutely hook you from the very first chapter the world building was perfection and so seamless that it never felt awkward and i was never confused about the fantasy world this is a world i would absolutely love to live ini have heard that a lot of people found this book predictable but im personally horrible at predicting endings so i may have forseen one or two things but i definitely could not have predicted the entire ending for this book and that made it that much more enjoyablei loved violets character so much her bond with her sister and her friends was so genuine she is tough and strong willed and is unstoppable despite her disadvantage which yarrow displayed so so well i loved her journey and how much she grew throughout this whole bookxaden rhysand has been my book boyfriend since i devoured acotar last year and no one has lived up to the hype since xaden freaking riorson has officially take my book boyfriend spot with rhysand as a very close second how can you not love this man he is an absolute simp from violet even from the start despite his grumpy exterior men who show their love through actions this man had me literally gasping and giggling like a little kid because of some of the things he did he was exactly what violet needed i loved their tension but also how he always believe in her and the nicknames the romance was perfection usually i get really impatient with slow burns but the fantasy aspect of this book was done so well that i was such as obsessed with the story as i was with the romance and enemies to lovers sign me tf up violet and xaden had the perfect build up between them and the spice puhlease absolutely amazingtairn and andarna were hands down the best part of this book yarros did so good with described all of the details of the dragons and giving them so much personality the interactions between the dragons and their riders were so much fun i loved tairns grumpy exterior his sassy comments and how protective he was of violet andarna is so freaking cute and i love her to deathi could honestly rave about every single aspect of this book but i feel like this really sums up some of my biggest feelings this is definitely a book that deserved all the hype and definitely a book that you need to read even if you arent a fantasy loverthis book was not perfect by any means like anything else this book had flaws but it was perfect to me i am obsessed it had everything i wanted from a fantasy book and dragons i cannot wait to get my hands on iron flame this is definitely a book that i will be rereading before book comes out i know for a fact that this will be the best book that i read for this yearpeep my kindle highlights from this book because it had the best quotes and xaden says the best things may have some spoilers so read at your own riska dragon without its rider is a tragedy a rider without their dragon is deadso then why are you here xaden because i cant seem to stay awaytheres nowhere in existence you could go that i wouldnt find you violence,positive
fourth wing the empyrean,i will be rereading this book my whole life i loved it so much,5,i saw the hype for this book everywhere and i saw many of my all time auto buy authors raving about this story so my expectations were set at an all time highi was not disappointed i legit read this book in hours in one day i started and finished this book and while i consumed it i knew i was going to be devastated when i finished well here i am devastated but also extremely happyalso there will be spoilers in this review for once i didnt read an early copy so i can say whatever i want and im oh so going to lolviolet violet i need to be her friend she is fantastic person so super smart i love that she wanted to be a scribe and be surrounded by books and her ability to retain information is amazing makes her the dangerous student in her school and her the brilliant plan she came up with for each of her sparring sessions made me jump up and down with joyxaden i loved him the second he learned violets name and threatened her life the tension between them was instantaneous and it was always sizzling between them with every encounter for them to have waited so long to cave in to their attraction was agonizing but so worth it though hes really put himself into a deep hole by the end of this book im really really going to enjoy seeing him pull out all the bells and whistles to gain violets trust again i know its going to be even more intense i beti honestly despise her mother i cannot believe she is willing to risk another child especially considering violet had only been training for months all because of their name and image i would have had a few choice words for her and then later when violet proved herself to her mothers standards and her mother ignored her hell no no no noanother person i hate dain that spineless weasel i cant stand him i need to be violets friend so i can punch him and break his nose i swear hes only out for himself one minute hes lecturing violet telling her what to do acting like shes not years old the next hes celebrating the exact thing he was scolding her about and acting like he was responsible for it just because he realized that he can be associated with her and her some fame from it or something and his the rules say oh just shove it dainthe amount of people after violet in this book is insane and that girl has so much luck on her sidealso i loved how many people died in this book do not get attached to many of these characters because they drop like fliesthe dragons the dragons i freaking love them every single second a dragon is on these pages im in love especially tarin hes hilarious and i love his and violets banterthe revolution happening is going to get crazy in the upcoming books im not the biggest fan of those but ill suffer through it to continue loving these charactersnow the biggest spoiler because i need to remember for book so you know dont read of you dont want spoilersi cant believe brennan is still alive how did he fake his death with his mother does she know is her mother in the dark how mad is violet going to be her father died from his death basically and violet loved her father also this is not going to go well with xaden keeping this from her and he better tell her every freaking secret in his life if he messed up what they have forever and she moves on to someone else ill never forgive himso suffice to say this book has me obsessed and im about to own copies at least the hype is worth it im telling everyone to read it and i cant wait for more,positive
fourth wing the empyrean,survival of the fittest on a whole other level,5,i am a reck after reading this book but in the best of ways i cannot remember the last time i have been left this way after finishing a book to where i am not sure what to do next whether it is to pick up another book or soak in what i have just finished i usually go with the former but this time i am probably going to do the later for a day or so rebecca yarros has successfully put me in a temporary book coma the world that yarros builds is absolutely stunning and the structure of government and military is solid and makes sense the characters she has created for this story gah i feel like i could wright an essay on quite a few of them easily and thats not just counting the main character violet but i do connect to her the most on a pretty deep levelthat connection being having a sever disadvantage in a field that doesnt do well with having just one but she doesnt let that stop her if anything it fuels her to prove everyone wrong i have had to do that myself and really through this book i realized i kind of forgotten to do that here recently and was reminded of that part of my self so i really admire violets tenacity determination and adaptably in every challenge she faces but our main character is not the only one i have strong feelings for yarros has this spectacular ability to get you to almost feel something for most of these characters in this book no matter how long they are in the book and boy will you feel some feelings while reading this so for warning feelings will be hadas for the romance and spice i have to say yet again it has been a while since i have been on edge for a relationship development in a story but again in the best of ways i would say slow burn is not even an adequate description for them while yes it takes a minute for our love interests to admit their feelings with each other the build up to that point wasnt a slow burn it was already an inferno really dont know how many times i sat there fanning myself and it wasnt even over a spicy scene but another thing i have to appreciate is that the romance does not over take the main story that is being told while the romance is to die for other relationships that are built or building in this story also captivate you as wellanother thing about this book that i have to commemorate the author for as a critique is how she is able to get you to feel about movements and the structure of this world as well you will feel wonder and awe along with sorrow horror and anger very easily as this world is developed and certain structures and systems are played out she has artfully and skillfully found that perfect balance in getting the reader to feel for pretty much the whole entire story and every aspect of it this is what i believe is what makes this such a great book to read it is the fact that she does not get you to just feel for the characters in the story but she gets you to feel for everything in this story i hope she is able to carry this through for the rest of the series because if she can then she has created something special for us and we better prepare to be recked some more for what is to come next,positive
fourth wing the empyrean,a certified page turner,5,rebecca yarros has it the gift of writing certifiable pageturners im an old hand at fantasy literature and im embarrassed to confess how often i robbed myself of sleep by reading one more chapter in fourth wing past my usual bedtime if she continues in this vein her new series will be a commercial blockbuster kudos it also qualifies as a crossover adultya series more on this later in the reviewto step back and give it a critical evaluation for any fantasy novel or series the first criteria is whether the world the author builds is interesting and believable the geography in fourth wing is pedestrian but serviceable the society adheres to the usual fantasy requirement of technological stagnation over a period of centuries the culture in fourth wing with its high level of literacy and the absence of plate armor resembles rome more than the usual medieval setting which is rather refreshing magic furnishes some quasimodern amenities eg mage lights that illuminate interior roomsthe society is interesting if rebecca were toiling in the star trek novel fields her riders quadrant would make a nice analogue of starfleet academy in the mirror universe martial arts training is all fullcontact edged weapons included cadets in this elite institution routinely kill each other with few repercussionsthe humandragon relationship is symbiotic a human to whom a dragon chooses to bond will acquire special abilities fueled by the dragons magical nature to use another star trek analogy human and dragon are like trill and symbiont while a dragon can survive the loss of its rider a human once bonded cannot survive the death of its dragonthe aspect of the society that i most appreciated is the obvious secret that the established ruling elites are ruthless bastards who carefully control the prevailing narratives to keep the masses in line and patriotic while themselves are completely amoral this is where rebeccas fantasy world shines with this resemblance to our contemporary worldthe heroine violet is an analogue of rebecca herself no fault there authors reimagining themselves in their fiction has a long and often successful history what makes violet interesting is that rebecca has replicated her own very difficult medical challenges in her heroine this is surely the first work of fiction in which forms of the word subluxation occur repeatedly i give her credit for this for it makes violet more interesting i cant help but be reminded of moorcooks elric whose physical weakness from his albinism is compensated for only by drugs or the possession of stormbringeri have a few literary criticisms none of which will detract from indeed theyll probable add to the series appeal for example applicants to the death factory that is the riders quadrant are almost puppydog eager to get in seemingly unoppressed by the reality that threequarters of them if i remember correctly will die during training they also look and talk like contemporary zoomers this is part of the ya appeal of the books but its a bit of a stretch to imagine contemporary zoomers cheerfully signing up for such a place the sex scenes are painstakingly detailed with truly anatomic precision for a ya audience i suppose this might be useful information but for an adult reader they become tedious rather quicklycongratulations rebecca i look forward to receiving my preorder of flame wing,positive
fourth wing the empyrean,i cant believe i waited so long to read this epic book,5,guys im not lying here is my year for reading i cannot tell you how many books ive read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier this novel is no exceptioncoming into this book i wasnt sure what to expect the only other book ive read by rebecca yarros is the things we leave unfinished also amazing but if youve read it you know its on a completely different playing field than this book i mean fourth wing is on a different world and isnt a historical romance novel it is epic though and im not using that word lightlyfourth wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of navarre where dragons griffins and magic are real if youve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog you know that i hardly ever review fantasy novels i honestly think the only other fantasy novel ive reviewed was the invisible life of addie larue which honestly was a real world fantasy so wasnt that far outside of my realm with that being said this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did i love it now im thinking ive been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and i might just go on a bingeso what exactly did i like about this novel everything but to break it down the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself the characters that dont necessarily make you think oh this again with the main heroine the unbeatable plot and the beautiful comical writing style that rebecca yarros demonstratesthe world building speaks for itself but the characters that dont follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel for instance our main heroine violet is way weaker than other riders she doesnt fit the mould while this is typical for our main character what follows isnt instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all she basically just adjusts she has to do things differently and doesnt just become a natural born rider its amazing and youll know what im talking about if youve read the bookthe plot is just like what i said unbeatable you have foreshadowing a romantic subplot tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel and man is it satisfying im not sure how long this series is going to be but i am here for itlastly rebecca yarros writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular you get epic battle scenes romantic moments that play with your heart and comical snips that make you laugh out loud it really does have everything and i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire noveloverall this review is huge but i had a lot to say i honestly cant even point to something that i disliked about this novel which just goes to show you how much i loved it and how great i think it is if you enjoy fantasy novels youll fall in love with this book if you dont enjoy fantasy novels youll still fall in love with this book ive already recommended it to my book club my mom and my brother yall are welcomefavorite quote and when others are quick to stand in front of me xaden always stands at my side trusting me to hold my own,positive
fourth wing the empyrean,we can live as cowards or die as riders,5,st personsingle pov with end chapter from alternate povspice welp i get it now all the hype surrounding this book had me not only excited to read it but nervous as well because i know from experience that some books have a big following but they dont always live up to my expectations once i read them yeah not a single doubt about this one now in fact it surpassed what expectations i had before opening it my husband even read it and he doesnt read stuff like this at all lol and loved every minute of it he finished and ran straight to audible to preorder the second book before i could myself this is the first ive read from this author and i liked how the worldbuilding was written to give you enough to completely picture their environment but not so much that it became boring or felt like it was added just to fill a chapter the character development was phenomenal and drawn out at a pace that felt natural never forced or rushed in order to get them where they needed to be for the end of the book speaking of the end of the book ill definitely be coming back to that one later and there is spice i dont know why but i wasnt expecting the spice that i got from it then i got to it and hellooooooo shadow daddy i assumed there would be some flirting and some fade to black stuff but nope rebecca gave us a fullon adult fantasy complete with tension steam and chemistry plus it was the perfect amount not too much and not too little my favorite thing though besides the killer storyline going on here is the little moments of humor and found family sprinkled throughout i love it when i can laugh with the characters in a book even if chaos andor danger is surrounding them humor and sarcasm are coping mechanisms for me so this not only had me engrossed in the story but it left me feeling like these characters were more alive than just words on a pageas for the ending let me just say that i never saw it coming i usually can spot the twists a mile away and i did in fact spot one of them but that wasnt the biggest one it wasnt the bombshell dropped at the last possible minute that made waiting for the next book torture even though it will be here in like a week or so lol i dont know how all of these people who read this when it came out havent gone mad with the wait because its only been days for me and im still trying not to scream over it anymoreso if youre about to jump into this one just buckle up its full of action laughs drama secrets suspense passion and so much more once you get to the last ish percent or so dont make any plans that will cause you to put this book down because you will wish you hadnt im telling you i could not function like a normal adult until i finished it i was angry i was shocked i bawled my eyes out i mean why rebecca just why i swooned all over the place and then my head exploded with six little words enjoy,positive

fourth wing the empyrean,lords of discipline dragonriders of pern steamy romance but it works,5,i first came across fourth wing when i noticed it in the position on amazons best science fiction and fantasy of so far but beyond that selection i looked at how the reviews were trending at the time there were more than reviews its now about to crest and the average was a whopping stars it has to be good for that many people to love it right in need of a palate cleanser after the difficult read that was the whispers i decided id limit the likelihood of another clunker and see what all the hype is about and im happy to say that i get why so many people love this book its pretty greatfourth wing is set at basgiath war college in the mythical land of navarre it opens on conscription day where thousands of twentyyearolds assemble to take their place among the healers scribes or infantry the most elite of them try to join the most selective branch and become dragon ridersour heroine is violet sorrengail bookish and smart yet frail she always imagined a future as a scribe just as her father had been but her mother is a rider and a general in the army and she has other ideas against violets wishes her mother insists she attempt to be a rider as well but this isnt an idle push in a different direction the stakes are the highest possible for those trying to become riders from the opening conscription challenge through bonding with a dragon there are dozens of opportunities to fail and any failure when attempting to become a rider equals deathin addition to the general peril of the tasks at hand there is also a ruthlessness among the members of the war college fewer classmates means better opportunities to bond a dragon and so the murder of fellow classmates while perhaps not encouraged is certainly allowed making every waking moment one filled with potential death yarros creates an interesting caste within the college of students who carry rebellion relics they are the children of adults involved in a rebellious uprising six years prior all of the adults were executed and the children were only spared execution as well by being forced into conscription as riders as a result they all tend to possess a brooding darkness you could think of them as the slytherin of basgiath to further complicate things for violet those children of the rebels all intensely hate her because violets mother was responsible for ordering their parents executionthe novel is packed with a ton of genrebending elements there is the basic plot violets unlikely journey through her first year at basgiath war college which stirred up memories of one of my alltime favorite books pat conroys the lords of discipline based on conroys first year at the citadel military college there are dragons and dragon riders which of course evokes memories of plenty of fantasy novels with anne mccaffreys dragonriders of pern series top of mind and then theres some romance and a potential love triangle which starts out feeling like something from a ya novel but ends up a lot more rrated and steamy and more akin to what you might find in a novel with fabio on the cover add to this a nuanced backstory and some misdirection on who the reader should trust and believe and fourth wing truly has something for everyonethere is depth to the story and characters which elevates the story and im sure plays a big role in the stellar reviews yarros handles relationships well whether its the strained relationship between violet and her mother the love between violet and her sister or the friendships violet forges with her classmates the romance is the romance honestly i could have done without it and while it was almost humorous at times it works for what it is meant to be yarros also does a standout job of presenting how her characters handle loss whether its grieving the loss of family members or their classmates there is an undercurrent of sadness and longing that affects many of the characters and hardens them to the task at hand despite the intensity of their training yarros does a pretty good job reminding us that theyre only in their early twenties and still figuring out a lot of lifei suspect a lot of the hype and enjoyment of the book is related to how yarros turns a straightforward year as a student story into something more i cant help but compare that to the harry potter books except of course harry never had hot magical sex with ginny weasley at least not within the pages of any of the books those novels changed significantly for me with the third book in the series the prisoner of azkaban where books and were decent and straightforward ya novels the prisoner of azkaban took the story to a more nuanced and mature level yarros does the same thing here but all within the pages of a single book i get why people are so drawn to the storyoverall its a winner its fun and while it feels derivative of several other novels it also combines those stories and plots in its own unique way book iron flame is already set for release this november ive already ordered my copy and so if you fall in love with the characters youll have the opportunity to spend more time with them before long well at least with those who survive fourth wing its a compelling read and like the other readers who have this trending at almost stars i dont think youll be disappointed,positive

killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,shameful history essential reading,5,david grann is one of our greatest nonfiction authors alive every topic he chooses is brought to life no matter how many years have passed since the events took place his writing is smooth and unobtrusive describing the past in a matteroffact approachable way if history books had been like this in high school wed all have gone on to be scholarskillers of the flower moon is an especially difficult book to read not because of the writing but because the subject is so painful grann documents how literally hundreds of osage were murdered for riches in the early th c as american indians their lives were worth less than that of dogs an entire corrupt and venal society was arrayed against them well aware they were systematically being murdered they had no recourse the authorities both political and legal were complicit in the murders no one would help save them from systematic eradicationthis is an excellent telling of a dark and shameful time in our history if only this much attention had been paid a hundred years ago some of the osage who were murdered might have lived,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,riveting account of murders of osage indians to steal their money,4,killers of the flower moon by david grann is a well documented tale of the murders of plus osage indians to steal their money it took place in the early s and became known as the reign of terror the land the osage indians were forced to live on was some of the richest oil reserves in the country the osage sold off some of the land but retained the mineral rights thus they owned the oil at one time they were the richest per capita people in the worldthe federal government determined the indian was incompetent and created a guardianship situation where a white man was appointed to oversee the expenditures of the funds in order to spend their own money for groceries or medicine or anything the indian had to meet with their guardian and get permission when the killings began two individuals were shot and their bodies left where they fell the sheriff didnt have any luck finding the killer when a house blew up killing an osage woman her white husband and a white maid a group of osage went to dc and appealed to the president to do something the fbi was created to address the situationit is a gripping story i was reading until am to get to who done it it has been made into an excellent movie by martin scorsese but the book provides more background,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,couldnt put i down,5,killers of the flower moon is the true story of the numerous murders of members of the osage native american tribe during the early s it was referred to as the reign of terror the osage community was incredibly wealthy because the supposedly worthless land in oklahoma to which they had been confined since was found to contain some of the largest oil reserves in the united states people flocked there to strip them of their wealth by any means possible including murder the situation was exacerbated by the government policy that claimed the osage were not competent enough to manage their money and thus white guardians were assigned to each osage native for that purpose this of course resulted in the guardians stealing from and murdering their clientsthe deaths began with several members of the osage community wasting away the local doctors attributed this to illness it was not until two members of the osage were shot and killed that it was acknowledged that there was a plot against the osage community but little was done to solve those murders when the bombing of an osage home resulted in the deaths of three people a new investigative group under the federal governments justice department was asked to look into the murders that department had a new director j edgar hoover hoover assigned tom white to the investigation white was successful in finding the murderers and having them prosecutedthe book also discusses the life of tom white who truly was an amazing man the author is very critical of hoover admittedly hoover was a man of massive ego but he did create an agency that developed the technical expertise and methods that allowed the solving of murders previously deemed unsolvablei rated this book stars for several reasons it is an extremely compelling story i could barely put it down it was very well written the authors research into this reign of terror was immense nor did he did limit his investigation to this time frame he also dug deep into the archives of osage history to find unsolved or mysterious deaths that occurred both before and after the reign of terror they were numerous he estimated that the murders began in and continued through the early s lastly it gave me an appreciation of the times in which i live i am often very distressed about the changes occurring in society but when i compare it to that eras rampant corruption and violence which was present throughout the whole of society not just the osage community i cannot help but believe that we as a nation have become a more just and empathetic society,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,highly recommend,5,killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi by david grann is an enthralling true story of the murder greed and fear that permeated the osage indian tribe for years in s oklahoma this is an extensively researched look at the oil rich osage and the prejudice which allowed white guardians to exploit the system to steal embezzle and murder their charges for their shares of oil rights and the newly formed fbi men who took on this murder investigationmolly burkhart watched as one by one her osage family and friends were killed some by gunshot some by poisoning and others never designated with a method of death since the tribe became the richest people in the us due to the oil under their land in the s the osage were considered unable to handle their wealth and the federal government decided that they should be appointed white guardians when anyone questioned the deaths they would mysteriously end up deadthe murder rate exceeded the national average when the government decided to send in men from the newly formed fbi under j edgar hoover at first they did no better than the corrupt local law enforcement until hoover sent in tom white he put together a team of his choosing who all entered the region undercover and soon began to piece together a conspiracy tied to the most influential rancher in the areathis book is intricately plotted not only making the characters come to life for the reader but to show the osage were set up to be exploited hopefully unintentionally by the federal governments decision that put the osage under guardianship the local white population took advantage of this system to follow the money and kill off family lines until the white guardians inherited the osage money and oil rights while this book focuses on the one conspiracy of criminals publicized in that time that were brought to trial after the fbis investigation the author discusses many other murders that were never investigated i was outraged by the prejudice heartsick by the killing and that is what i hope to feel and more when reading a book about a historical atrocity the descendants of the osage are still looking for justice and closure which will never comei highly recommend this compelling historical true crime mystery,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,different but important,5,no spoilers here we saw the movie killers of the flower moon before we read the book both the movie and the book are excellent in that they tell an extremely important and heretofore rather hidden story in our manifest destiny duplicitous and murderous gaining of land to create this country the movie tells the story through the life events of an anglo man married to an osage woman the book tells the same story through the eyes of the fbis unravelling of the deceit and murders that interlopers used to gain access to the money the osage were due for the oil rights on their land usually i read a book before i see the related movie but im glad i saw this movie firstfor me it helped to know the characters while reading the book,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,should be requested reading in history classes,5,thank you david grann for this history lesson the more i learn of what the white man did to the indigenous peoples of the north american continent the more ashamed i am it is information and history we need to learn and remember so that we do not repeat it money and greed and power are truly crimes of their own and humanity must teach the young to care for each other we can learn from history and be better in our leaning thank you for a thoughtful telling of a very dark time i wonder now if anything similar happened to other tribes in oklahoma and other states the miami tribe and most others were robbed of their ancestral homes in the s the miamis and neighboring tribes had mining in northeast oklahoma it would be interesting to know if there were murders similar to the osage in that region thank you for this research and for sharing it with the world,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,the amount and scale of the research,5,i just finished this book a couple of days ago my intent was to finish the book before i saw the movie now im not sure i want to see the movie because there is so much going on in the book that really cant be conveyed on the screen reading all terrible things that were done to the osage by whites in the guise of doing what is best for them was beyond my comprehension sadly nothing has really changed we gave them the crappiest land we could find for the osage thinking that they would not survive and then they did and we tried to take that from them too how do whites atone for these crimes how do we apologize for committing genocide on native peoples and then turning our backs in them,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,what is most disquieting about the crimes in killers of the flower moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in,5,killers of the flower moon by david grannnew york doubleday pagesthe whites have bunched us up down here in the backwoodsthe roughest part of the united states thinking we will drive theseindians down to where there is a big pile of rock and put them therein that corner now that pile of rock has turned out to be worth millionsof dollars now everybody wants to get in here and get some of the money osage chief bacon rindperhaps the most remarkable aspect of david granns killers of the flower moon is the fact that despite the authors painstaking research and his marvelous use of period photographs and documents this factual account of historic events attending the osage murders contains the atmospheric suspense and tension that is normally associated with a classic murder mystery in fact grann has written a murder mystery one that asks who methodically killed hundreds of osage indians during a fouryear reign of terror osage history reveals the tragic details of how and why forced to move from kansas to oklahoma the osage tribe seemed to be destined to lives of abject poverty when they suddenly found itself catapulted into a world of excessive wealth oil is discovered on tribal land suddenly every member of the tribe is potentially wealthy in an attempt to control the chaos that ensued the federal government created a document called a headright which gave each osage household legal rights to the oil on their land after a period of uncontrolled spending in which members of the osage tribe acquired mansions and fleets of automobiles the government attempted to control the excessive spending by establishing a guardian system which assigned a legal guardian to each osage family this guardian usually a white banker businessmen or civicminded citizen was given the power to approve or deny all expenditures for the osage tribal member who had been judged to be incompetent by the government the system was badly flawed and many of the guardians used their position to embezzle huge sums of money in time the guardian documents became bargaining chips in investing in business ventures hundreds of guardians used their position as a means of acting as a middleman who would purchase items on behalf of osage tribal members the guardian would then sell the item to the osage for an inflated price for example guardians could purchase automobiles on behalf of the osage tribal member for and then sell them to the osage member that they represented for as the wealth of the osage grew so did the schemes for exploiting the tribe hundreds of criminals were drawn to the region with schemes designed to acquire a portion of osage wealth many of these new arrivals openly stated that they had come to oklahoma to marry an osage squawit was a method that frequently succeeded however some of these opportunists sought a more direct method murder author granns research discovers one individual william hale who had arranged for the murder of members of the osage tribe by soliciting the help of associates hale became one of the wealthiest men in oklahoma the astonishing catalogue of slaughter is carried out by men willing to resort to any means to accomplish hales goal dozens of victims were poisoned with tainted moonshine and corrupt medical personnel performed autopsies that listed acute alcoholism as the cause of death others were dispatched with a bullet to the back of the head or between the eyes and the victims body was found in his new car on a remote road one family was killed by a dynamite blast that demolished their home often hale simply paid an assassin to kill a designated victim then hale would frequently hire a second assassin to kill the first in those instances in which murderers were apprehended hale bribed juries and law officials and if all else failed he simply paid another killer time and time again government agents are assigned to investigate and in some instances just as they uncover significant evidence they are murdered and the evidence destroyed one dedicated investigator called the fbi headquarters to report that he was on his way back with conclusive evidence against hale the next day his mutilated body is found near a railroad track he had been murdered and thrown from the train another investigators body was found in another state hundreds of miles away what is most disquieting about the crimes in killers of the flower moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in the book state and government officials medical personnel and lawyers all are contaminated with the vice of greed the corruption is so pervasive the few moral and courageous individuals seem helplessly outnumbered however there are two remarkable people in this gruesome tale one is molly burkhart and osage who survived the systematic murder of her familymurders in which her husband was implicated molly was diagnosed as a diabetic by two doctors who poisoned her insulin injections in an attempt to slowly kill her molly survived and divorced her husband the second remarkable character is tom white the fbi agent that pursued hale until he brought him to justice much of the credit of for this amazing piece of investigative work went to the director of the newlycreated fbi agency hubert hoover who turned out to be a man dedicated to his own selfinterest through much of the investigation conducted by tom white hoover managed to take credit for whites courageous work jealous of any publicity directed toward agents other than himself hoover invariably succeeded in manipulating the factual data to his advantage this is a remarkable work most noteworthy is granns comprehensive account of the primitive nature of investigations in a time before forensics emerged as a consequence much of tom whites heroic pursuit of a villain who seemed to have the protection of most of oklahomas judges lawyers and public officials however granns greatest achievement is the fact that he uncovers evidence that the total number of victims in the osage murders exceeded the original and possibly exceeded over,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,an even deeper and more sinister layer,4,there is an even deeper layer of murderous intent and execution than is covered by the book one that involves the destruction of millions of persons of color and nonamerican whites ever since just a few years after the founding of the terrible united states of america its army and marines have been abroad everywhere destroying other ppl for their money land and commodities already in the us marines were trying to wrestle power from the legitimate rulers of libya see the battle of dernaamerican politicians and their military power have for years destroyed millions of nonamerican whites brown and black incompetents these fullblooded white american guardians have been subduing robbing impoverishing and finally destroying us not just in their own country but all over the planet god help us,positive
killers of the flower moon the osage murders and the birth of the fbi,another largely forgotten piece of american history brought back to life,5,american history is loaded with episodes of shame a large percentage of our less memorable moments as a nation have been swept under the rug kept out of classrooms and largely forgotten as time progresses but these events are real and all it takes is a skilled author to bring the lost history back to life such is the case with killers of the flower mooni did not know anything about these murders against the osage until i read this book so this was a definite eye opener for me i had heard of the osage tribe yes but i did not know they fell into tremendous oil wealth and subsequently saw their members slowly dying off either through gunfire or poisoning as greedy individuals tried to get their hands on some easy cash the book details several of the known killings and the cold callous calculated murders are chilling and puzzling chilling because of the gruesomeness of the murders puzzling because of the nonchalant behavior of those who plotted the killings even when confronted with the murders most of the guilty individuals seem to have no remorse at all they dont even perceive what they did as immoral in any waythis book reads like a mystery thriller however it isnt a page turner like some mystery genre books you do start to make guesses as to who is responsible but rather than get wound up in the who done it the book grips you more for its educational aspects you learn all sorts of things about the oklahoma region that the osage called home you learn about the newly formed fbi and its role in solving the mystery you learn about the problems of racism and the feelings of superiority that people felt against indians and you learn just how evil people can be when vast amounts of wealth are at stakethere are several surprises in this book and one is the books final section the book leads you to believe that the mystery has been solved and it sounds like everything is coming to a close then suddenly the book continues for dozens more pages as the author tries to solve more of the mystery on his own with the aid of local osage tribe members no one will ever know exactly how many people were killed during this reign of terror but i like how the author took it on himself to investigate and try to answer more questionsthis book is another solid educational wakeup call on the prevalence of racism and superiority that pervaded society in the past and is rearing its ugly head once again today i like how the book includes pictures so that you can get to know the many characters involved with so many names and so many people involved its easy to lose track of who is who the pictures help you put a face with the name but the most important part of this book is its educational value its another sad shameful episode from americas past and one that we all need to know about and hopefully learn from,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,a beautiful and enlightening world war ii novel,5,if i could give all the light we cannot see more than five stars i would i read this amazing book on kindle and listened to it on audible as well btw the narrator on audible zach appelman is really excellent his ability to pronounce the french and german names his articulation and his pregnant pauses really

well i have given five stars to quite a few writers all the light we cannot see is a higher level of excellence that not many authors achieve no wonder anthony doerr won the pulitzer prize for fiction with this bookthe chapters are short and beautifully written i could say beautifully and elegantly painted they remind me of a painting this book is poetic creative imaginative and historically enlightening as well science and technology its fascination and the power to help or harm is explored along with the characters thoughts and feelings we learn about their courage or lack of and why they make their individual decisions during the rise of hitler and on into world war ii the descriptions are incredibly sensitive and vivid objects are palpable i could see and feel them the book pulled me in so much that i was part of each scene the poignant images remained with me and made the characters come alivethe author skillfully writes using a juxtaposition of events in the life of a blind french girl marielaure leblanc and that of a german boy werner pfennig towards the end of the book their lives meetmarielaure the blind french girl lives with her father in paris she became blind at years old due to congenital cataracts she has developed her other senses namely hearing touch and smell to compensate for her loss of sight in her imagination she can see colors when she uses her other senses to explore her world her father carves wooden replicas of all the buildings in paris for her to learn to find her way home by herself he is a very devoted and loving father and teaches her independence but promises her he will always be there for her and will never leave her he is the master locksmith at the museum of natural history marielaure who is a curious and bright child goes with him to work and studies paleontology archeology geology and other branches of science with dr gefford while her father worksthe boy werner lives in an orphanage childrens house in zollverein germany the children in the orphanage are very close to starving a good deal of the population is very poor and not getting enough to eat when hitler comes to power the economy improves dramatically people are getting more food meat even and new appliances the german population is inundated with radio propaganda only state supported german radio channels are allowed the german population is brainwashed the people think hitler is helping them climb out of poverty build a better society and take pride in their country againyet the future looks bleak to werner nazi officials tell the boys in the orphanage that they will all have to work in the coalmines when they turn years of age werners father had died in the coal mines and werner is not happy with the prospect of being underground in the dark pit of the mines after finding a broken radio in the city trash werner gets it working his fascination with radios and his skill in fixing them gives him a chance to escape the coal mines and go to paramilitary school he has a chance to pursue his interest in radio technology and contribute to the new germany he visualizes a glorious future in the attic at the orphanage werner and his sister jutta had listened to foreign radio stations that were illegal under nazi rule a french radio station with science lectures fascinated them how magical it was to hear a voice from afar transmitted through the air jutta liked a program on magnets werner liked the program on light what do we call visible light we call it color but the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other so really children mathematically all of light is invisible the radio was a symbol of freedom for them both the freedom to learn and dreambefore he leaves for school however werner smashes the radio he does not want anything to interfere with his chance for what he thinks will be a better life listening to foreign radio stations is illegal and dangerous jutta a free spirit with a strong moral compass feels betrayed she thinks her brother is turning into a cold brutal nazi like hans and herribert two older boys in the orphanage who have joined the brownshirted hitler youth she insists that the broadcasts from the foreign radio stations say the germans are committing atrocities just the opposite of what they hear on the stateowned german stationswerner gets caught up with his study of radios and blocks out the brutality around him at school despite his lack of courage to go against the dictates of his german superiors the reader can see his conflict and the goodness in him that he wants to embrace his friend frederick a birdlover and dreamer is called the weakest by the field commander but shows his courage by refusing to participate in the brutal death of a prisoner frederick pays for it by being beaten so badly that he becomes no more than a living vegetablewith the invasion of paris in marielaure and her father

french resistance and marielaure takes over some of her activities when the housekeeper becomes ill upon madame manecs death from pneumonia etienne gets his courage up and joins the french resistancewerner finds himself caught up in the brutality with no way to escape his skill in detecting enemy radio transmissions results in many deaths some of them innocent civilians he is haunted by the deaths especially that of one little girl in vienna who reminded him of his sister jutta werner is sent to saintmalo to find the source of the radio transmissions of the french resistance he finds marielaures broadcasts but does not expose her he recognizes the radio programs that had inspired him so much as a child when he hears her voice saying that someone is in her house and is going to kill her he vows to save her if he can reach her in time werner finds her and saves her life the americans are bombing the town but during a lull he helps her escape saintmalointertwined with the lives of our two main characters marielaure and werner fairytale and reality collide the legend of the sea of flames a carat diamond said to be the intended gift of the goddess of the earth to the god of the sea parallels the calamities the characters experience in their lives it was said that the person who had the diamond would live forever but those he loved around him would die if the stone were returned to the sea the curse would be lifted especially during the bombing of saintmalo marielaure and werner both draw parallels to their own predicaments and jules vernes twenty thousand leagues under the sea trapped in the basement of the hotel of bees in saintmalo werner listens to marielaures broadcasts of the science programs and music that had been recorded by her deceased grandfather he thinks of captain nemo being trapped under the sea in the nautilus werner and his fellow german soldier volkheimer have run out of food and water and have very little air who could possibly calculate the minimum time required for us to get out might we not be asphyxiated before the nautilus could surface are more monsters awaiting them when they do surfacemarielaure is trapped in her uncle etiennes secret attic room where he had broadcast codes for the french resistance down below is an intruder the nazi sergeant major von rumpel he is there to find the sea of flames diamond which her father hid in the wooden house replica of her great uncles house instead of giving it to the reich for hitlers dream museum in linz austria he wants to have the enchanted diamond to cure his cancerous tumor he is dying and he believes the diamond will save his life marielaure has not had food for two days and has had no water for one and a half days she starts to think maybe this nazi will spare her life if she gives him the diamond maybe the curse would end and her father would come back not trusting her safety however she has a knife handy she thinks of captain nemo when he said to ned land the canadian harpooner but let me tell you that if were caught im going to defend myself even if i die doing itthere are many levels to this book and much to think about the reader can get many insights into the human condition and why someone like hitler could take over germany and spread his sickness into so many other countries the book is well researched and taught me a good deal about how it was to grow up in germany when hitler came to power additionally i could understand more concretely how it was for the french when france was invaded by hitlers armies good historical fiction brings all these events to life anthony doerr brings a powerful humanism to the events in world war ii he made the characters come alive for me this is a book to ponder reread and treasure the author brings an incredible immediacy to his writing that will draw you in and stay with you perhaps forever,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,its as if he sacrificed characters for beautiful prose,2,anthony doerrs descriptions are like no others he molds landscapes wars with words until my heart thumped from the vision he created for me theyre unique id like to share a few of the descriptions that i enjoyedto the bombardiers the walled city on its granite headland drawing ever closer looks like an unholy tooth something black and dangerous a final abscess to be lanced awaythe appetite for oxygen is such that objects heavier than housecats are dragged into the flameshis breath smells like crushed insectsas though a weary tide stirs stones in the old womans lungsthe way he guides the readers vision of a place destruction appearance made me wish i had a pinky size of his talent im a reader who loves and underlines phrases and sentences that stand out that i havent read before strands of words like a string of pearls fitted together to catapult me into another world who let me become friends or enemies with the characters some writers know how to bring me into their worlds where i get to exercise all senses and emotionsthere will be spoilers in this review so if you plan on reading the book dont read this review i do want to mention that im not a fan of some of the classics a reader needs patience to trudge through pages of description ive tried the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas and anna karenina by leo tolstoy maybe im just not that intelligent to appreciate and distinguish fine prose whatever the reason this may give you an idea as to whether or not you want to continue readingthat said i feel like doerrs novel falls into a classics categoryfull of description i really wanted to love this book its safe to say i wasnt the audience he had in mind when writing it and im in the minority of disliking it as much as i adore his descriptions i equally dislike his writing style its as if he sacrificed characters for beautiful prose the amount of descriptions tangents lists and short chapters swallow up the characters if i cant connect with them theres no way im going to like the book this book is roughly pages long it really should have been half its lengthpoint of viewfirst the book is told in third person omniscient meaning the narrator knows all the thoughts and feelings of the characters the narrator isnt a character nor does the narration come from a characters perspective its some unknown person telling me all about the thoughts and feelings of the personas i cant recall reading a book with this pov but i dont like it eleven percent into the book my frustration got the best of me the pov and descriptions muddled my experience there were passages where i couldnt figure out if it was the characters thoughts or feelings or the narratorsblock out giant frank volkheimer with his mammoth boots and cinderblock jaw block out the little aristocratic professor pacing in front of the hearth and the late hour and the dogs and the shelves brimming with interesting things there is only this when reading this passage it sounded as if werner was talking to himself but he couldnt be since its in third personthe first policeman snaps flesh off his apple with his teeth are they looking at her uh shes blind the narrator is telling me what the police are doing and then jumps into marielaures head at first i thought marielaure was describing the policeman and then wondering if they were looking at her this wouldnt work either because if she doesnt know if theyre looking at her she wouldnt know what the policeman is doingprosethere were images in the book where i couldnt picture it maybe im dense but it just didnt sound right this might seem nitpicky however doerr is praised for his proseprose that took tenyears to write ill share a few examples with youand she thinks she can smell threads of dust cascading from the ceiling two issues with this description how does one smell threads of dust and how does a girl who goes blind at the age of six think she smells threads of dustin the gloaming to the east he can make out a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road gloaming i had to look that up which means twilight dusk okay its not his fault my vocabulary is limited but it made me think if gloam has more power than twilight gloam is something i can see in a poem why not just say the twilight in the east revealed a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the roadthe eggs taste like clouds like spun gold huh this is such a weird comparison how do clouds taste and if ive ever tasted them they sure as heck wouldnt taste like eggs or spun gold which i would never eat unless someone wanted to steal it from melistsdoerrs writing also consists of lists throughout the book i call the separate words or phrases placed one after the other as lists hes a natural born list maker which drove me nuts and came off as page fillerslight electricity ether space time mass heinrich hertzs principles of mechanics heissmeyers famous schools code breaking rocket propulsion all the latestmarielaure wakes to church bells two three four five he does this too much in the book that it lost its flair wind immediate bright sweet briny luminousalong with the lists doerr also counts she wakes to madame manecs blocky pumps climbing to the third floor the fourth the fifth no punctuation and continues the counting her heart beats two four six eight counting doesnt build intrigue so why have itstatic static static static static in his functioning ear in the radio in the air gahtangentsthen there are tangents many times the narrator tells us the characters are recalling memories when doerr should have put more time into the moment hell start a chapter about a character the character starts thinking about the past and then the chapter endscharactersdoerr spent plenty of time giving me a visualization of the places yet he fell short of showing me the characters also the abundance of small chapters create long gaps between characters for instance chapter talks about von rumples diagnosis and if im not mistaken the next mention of him is chapter to top it off in regards to marielaure the narrator tells me she thinks or she feels instead of showing me what she thought or what she felt and sometimes it being impossible when talking about marielaure the author should have applied the senses using his beautiful prose shes blind so use her touch smell taste to understand where she is or how she came to an assumption instead doerr uses the narrator below are a few ive chosenat the top she stands she has the sense of a long slopewalled space pressed beneath the gable of the roof how does she sense this without touch the author describes so many things indepth and then just states how she senses it she has needed her father to make a replica of the town which she memorized over the years yet she can sense this areabut marielaure is certain that when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here madame dropped off one envelope and picked up another the girl is blind did she hear the rustling of paper a handshake marielaure heard the rustling of paper when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here a slight snigger escaped their lips before they moved oninsects drone wasps hoverlies a passing dragonflyetienne has taught marielaure to distinguish each by its sound etienne hasnt been out of the house in about twentyyears and marie only goes to certain places how is it that he taught her how to distinguish between these soundsthese additional descriptions are some issues i had with other charactersyour problem werner says frederick is that you still believe you own your life this couldnt be farther from the truth werner never acted as if he owned his life frederick did frederick continued to be himself he stood up and refused to pour cold water on a prisoner the women in town who transferred information to one another had more guts than wernerin the chapter diagnosis the author throws in a little bit about the medical exam while the rest of the chapter is about finding jewels doerr has the characters reflect on other things instead of describing the momenttheres a passage where werner sneaks away to see frederick in the infirmary hes talking to a nurse and then out of the blue comes each time he blinks he sees the men of his childhood laidoff miners drifting through back alleys men with hooks for fingers and vacuums for eyes he sees bastian standing over a smoking river snow falling all around him again the author takes us into a reflection without really describing the moment i also couldnt make the connection between the conversation and his thoughts of the pastthe past thoughts with the short chapters and flipflopping from one character to another prevented me from having an emotional connection i didnt care about them except for frederick when werner died i didnt feel sorry for him or cry which shocked me since i cry just watching a hallmark moviedue to all of these issues i gave this book a star rating,negative
all the light we cannot see a novel,stunning,5,daddy are you crying why are you crying that was my daughter when she came downstairs the morning i finished this book to find me sitting on the couch clutching it on my lap i cant remember the last time i read something that affected me in this powerful a waythe spiral construction of the plot reminded me of a symphony with stories that initially seem disparate but then you start to recognize patterns and see how the parts fit together and long before the end you are marveling at the brilliance of how the author can have conceived of it all and just as impactful was the exquisite poetic language and how doerr describes the most ordinary details of life in a way that makes you realize how beautiful those things you normally dont even notice arei think what made me cry when i finished it was something that happened near the end which i wont go into so as not to spoil it for anyone the way characters in the story retain their decency and humanity in the midst of the horrors of war and most of all the fact that it was over and i wouldnt be able to keep reading it any more,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,see the light through superb writing with profound lessons,5,being the recipient of the pulitzer prize for fiction my expectations for all the light we cannot see were extremely high with all things considered i feel confident in saying that the critical acclaim was warranted and deserved in this case despite two minor annoyances which i cover at the end all the light we cannot see is a phenomenally written percipient and remarkable example of sound literatureauthor anthony doerr tells the story of how years old werner a geeky crafty and thoughtful engineering prodigy in germany meets years old marielaure a sweet astute and affable blind french girl during the siege of saintmalo in wwii with all its stentorian and fervid trappings of war is the backdrop to werner and marielaures fateful encounter written in short but vividly described intricately woven chapters the backstory of how they are brought together is told over the course of ten years starting in and flashing back as far as through alternating timelines from both their perspectives they meet and thereafter the aftermath and implications of the encounter is written about up until the year several pages into the novel i knew i had a special literary piece in my hands werner and marielaure are easy to fall in love with as doerr writes them in a way that is honest and open they are both multifaceted in their strengths and their vulnerabilities without either one playing a victim or at least i never saw either one as a victim i also appreciated that foibles frailty and other unsavory personality traits are depicted for both allowing them to be alive with authenticity i never want to read about characters who are too perfect and give the sun the moon and the stars all of the time in the case of this novel the two main protagonists are realistic for their time and for the circumstances they find themselves in joining werner and marielaure is a dynamic and at times unfortunate mix of supporting characters who collectively illuminate the radiance and light of when humanity is good and kind juxtaposed others in the mix depict the ugly darkness of when humanity resorts to selfishness and evil though they are fictional we should all be so lucky as to encounter characters like frederick madame manec frau elena and dr geffard and hope the world breeds less of dr hauptmann bastian and reinhold von rumpelall the light we cannot see has many lessons to impart on the reader with one of the most profound being the titular light that we must all see the novel soundly shows us how those who are blind in the literal sense can see more than those who have the ability to gaze as far as their eyes will carry additionally the novel allows the reader to see for themselves how people whose visions are symbolically foggy can still find goodness of heart and lightness of mind in unlikely places and in the unlikeliest of people thoughtprovokingly doerr weaves for the reader how darkness creeps and consumes those who choose to be figuratively blind and who later become disillusioned by their own rancor malevolence and enmity in the heart of strongwilled characters we see how love patience understanding and empathy become the key that open and illuminate the path into lighti very much enjoyed this read and surprisingly the short chapters were not an annoyance as can sometimes be when the author is not skilled enough to execute them doerr is skilled and in the case of all the light we cannot see he in what was in many instances only a page and a half or even only half a page has written cohesive chapters that are richly dense brimming with cerebral atmosphere that envelopes the reader at the turn of every page in this regard i could see marielaures loneliness and werners moral conflict i felt the fear and uncertainty in jutta daniel leblanc and etiennes reticence i could taste the saltiness in the breeze that wafted over saintmalo while also i could smell the acrid grey and gritty skies of zollverein each time a character was famished due to scant war rations i tasted the sweetness of the cool water they drank and i could taste the crust and crumb of the loaf of bread they tore apart these are not things easy to achieve in books doerr however has done so fantasticallyit goes without saying that there is plenty beauty and radiance to be found in all the light we cannot see some of it emanates directly from the characters while other times it comes from the readers own willingness to be openminded taking that into mind there were only two minor concerns i had with the novel first being that when the author went into descriptive details of radio repair and engineering principles my eyes would on occasion glaze over a bit since neither subject matter are strengths of mine nevertheless as a curious reader i know that it was necessary for me and other readers to know werners technical acumen when the author painstakingly described the workings of transmitters transceivers and the intricacies of repairing electronicsthe second minor concern i had with the novel was the very last chapter which covered the year so that i dont inadvertently give spoilers i will simply say that i would have liked this chapter better if it was written differently i loved the significance of it and the observations made but i would have liked it better minus the game playing grandson also i would have preferred the scene take place during a final visit to saintmalo rather than where the scene is depicted even better would have been if this very last chapter had been cut altogether ending the novel on the previous chapter labeled frederick would have had a better impact in my viewdespite the minor misstep in the last chapter all the light we cannot see is superb all around and i absolutely recommend it i also want to point out that unlike some readers the back and forth narrative depicting differing timelines and differing character perspectives did not bother me one bit this is a technique that i appreciate and think it is one of the reasons why this novel is so special readers who complain about this nonlinear technique must challenge their ability or lack of it to retain multiple levels of story details as the plot progresses for serious readers who like their books to have weighty loaded implications and for readers who appreciate intelligent writing that give literary gifts every turn of the page all the light we cannot see is for you read carefully and open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever stars,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,brilliant historical fiction,5,all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr has been discussed so many times on social media im not sure i can add or say anything more that hasnt already been said i thought the book was different and exceptional and i can fully understand how it won a pulitzer prize from the story itself to the characters contained within i thought it was brilliant i know several readers did not like the constant change in timeline but for me it left me in suspense and turning the pages for those who havent read it its the story of a year old blind girl named marielaure and werner a young german boy and their perspectives and experiences in france during wwii i have read a lot of wonderful fiction centering around wwii but this book is unique in its storytelling and writing i have to say for several days i found myself unable to begin another book i just didnt want to let go of the characters i cant say i was completely happy with the ending but such is life all i did was bend my spouses ear for days about the book i think he was happy when i finally moved on to care about a book that much says a lot about the writing,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,an intimate retelling of a story you think you know,5,right away we meet the girl year old marielaure leblanc who grew up in paris and lost her sight at the age of she is the only daughter of a widowed father daniel leblanc who works at the museum of natural history as the locksmith prior to the german occupation of paris and we meet the boy year old german private werner pfennig who grew up in zollverein a coal mining town miles northeast of paris we are alongside adolescent werner and his younger sister jutta when they find a crude radio which he begins to dissemble and assemble because nothing hes encountered before has made so much sense the reich learns of his aptitude with electronics and invites him at to attend jungmanner a military training camp for the best and brightest where he is instructed to eat country and breathe nation he is described as this snowy haired dreamer plucked out of the sootthe author uses alternating chapters to reveal the back story of each character and to bring each character eventually to the walled city of saintmalo in one story the germans occupy paris so marielaure journeys with her father as a last resort to stay with her great uncle etienne in a house number rue vauborel which is also richly detailed in our parallel story the boy werner is currently stationed at the hotel of bees

however is the last citadel for the germans and residents fear there may be a thousand or more germans ready to die for their cause four years of occupation and now a real sense of urgency the author describes leaflets dropped by planes to warn residents to find shelter or leave before an impending airstrike marielaures father is being held somewhere though and she decides to wait for his return the bombers plan to cross the channel at midnight those chapters describing the present ratchet the growing concern of the citizens of saintmalo as the reader meets many of the neighbors and

model of each structure and street on saintmalothe ny times review had this to say about werner as the words of his teachers fight the power of his memories an inner voice tells him open your eyes and see what you can see with them before they close forever this resonates so strongly with the reader because in our parallel story marielaure navigates by touch and then by memorythroughout the story powerful images resonate nighttime readings over the radio john james audubon sketches canned peaches barnacles a boiling frog how does it happen that werner when he opens his hand there is a little iron key in his palmso who should read this bookthis book is perfect for readers who love geography the place itself is fascinating the reader can see in pictures of the walled city of saintmalo a natural isolation brought on by the tides this was the brightest jewel of the emerald coast of brittany france prior to the german occupation and its easy to see why they continue to hold on to itthis book is perfect for readers who love historical fiction the pivotal event of the story is well documented the book provides an insider perspective to the events of the day eyes on the ground so to speak through the observations and movements of werner combined with those of the whelk and the blade the book has been criticized for glossing over the hardships of war im not sure i agree the wartime hardships here are intimate personalthis book is perfect for readers who love familiar literature drawing parallels or individual observations about twenty thousand leagues under the sea and the fate of captain nemothis book is also for readers who like to read aloud some of the chapters are short like diary entries and the novel is presented in an extremely readable formatwhat does the title meanthe first thing that comes to my mind when i think all the light we cannot see is marielaures inherent hope and optimism she waits for her father she ventures out she takes action she lives her life in spite of her handicap she encourages this feeling in those close to her for me this light expands beyond marielaure to include the good in her uncle neighbors friends werner jutta we read of small and large acts of courage of defiance of hopethe light in the title is also a topic werner hears discussed on a late s radio broadcast about the brains power to create light in darkness coal mines blackouts blindness the phrase open your eyes and see pops up in several different places in the novel conversely the author writes to shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindnessand if light is truth there are many examples where we are confronted by lies the letter from marielaures father the letter from werner to jutta and where characters decide to hide the real truth or not to interpret it correctlynotable quotesopen your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever pages there are he assures her no such thing as curses there is luck maybe bad or good a

all the light we cannot see a novel,carried away to another world,5,warning contains spoilersanthony doerrs novel all the light we cannot see is a story of survival courage sacrifice suffering family friendship love hope and survival its set in france and germany during ww iihow many thousands of novels does that thumbnail description fit jaded publishers and others in the business are starting to think of such novels as just another ww ii book which might account for some of the tepid reviews the novel got before it circulated through the wider reading communityall the light we cannot see is one of the richest most readable discussable and likeable ww ii novels ever yes likeable a narrative of war and suffering and death becomes a hopeful hymn about family kindness potential magic love and mysterydoerr brilliantly shows us the specifics in the general the character so unique and real that the reader can become the character and thus we can truly cloak ourselves in the potential for individual goodness in the storm of a world gone mad we learn and are comforted by how we might behave in a similar situationin the final analysis the story belongs to marielaure the little blind girl with the father who keeps thousands of keys for the national museum of natural history and is a gifted woodcarver in both paris and saintmalo he carves tiny clever models of their neighborhoods which marielaure must memorize with her fingertips then by counting grates benches streets and tapping her other senses for cues she must show him she can navigate their neighborhood he also teaches her to use her cleverness to unlock tiny objects to find the treasures inside to this reviewer those incredible miniatures made in such a rush by a father for his vulnerable sixyear old girl as the germans draw near are the most unforgettable takeaways of the novel and as her world is going up in conflagration marielaures fingertips race across the braille dots to open another world the world of twenty thousand leagues beneath the sea which she broadcasts as the bombs fall marielaure with her blindness has a huge capacity for the world and human experiencethen there is werner a german boy whose snowy white hair is almost as much a character marker as marielaures blindness he is an undersized orphan trying to look after his sister and others in the industrial area of zollverein germany werner has a preternatural gift for mathematics and radios and as a result is spared going into the mines but is scooped up into the german army where he becomes a radio operatormarielaure and werner cross paths when the allies begin bombing the holdout of saintmalo in early august during the most intense part of the circular reiterative narrative werner is trapped in the basement of the hotel of bees because of a bomb hit marielaure is trapped not far away in the attic of her uncles house with the cursed jewel the sea of flames in her possession a mad dying nazi stalks the downstairs desperate to get at the jewel which he believes will save his lifethankfully doerr lets a long comforting resolution play out as we see what happens to the survivors of the bombing of saintmalo we see the survivors intermittently as they go about lifeafterthewar until the novels pub date so vicariously was i participating in this novel if i should go to paris this year fat chance i would keep an eye out for an elderly blind lady who seems to know where she is going and i do believe some evil potential buffeted and stained to look like ordinary sea rock is always being swished around on the ocean floor waiting to be found and polisheddoerr expands the literal plot line thishappensthenthishappensthenthishappens with a richness of inversions paradoxes oxymorons juxtapositions repetitions symbols and motifs that invite the reader to go beyond the storyline for example clearly a mollusk is not just a mollusk and whats with all those birds before two of the most heartbreaking events of the narrative the rape and werners death why are there quasieucharistic events why is the fabulous diamond the sea of flames given such an oxymoronic name how can we not see light why is twenty thousand leagues beneath the sea the message of comfort to all who hear marielaures last broadcast on the surface it would seem to be an inversion of the usual message of hope why can the story be read pretty effectively backwardsdoerrs story has become an earwig certain images characters events and themes will always remain in my head more than any novel ive read in years i felt that i was buried with werner below the hotel of bees i was in the cold orphanage attic with him when as a boy he listened to a faraway voice talking about the nature of light on the radio i was as hungry as marielaure contemplating opening the last unlabeled can of food in the atticas an adult who has read a gazillion novels ive largely lost my childhood ability to be carried away into another world by a story so thank you anthony doerr for letting me do that again,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,one of my favorite reads this year,5,i find this review a bit difficult to write because honestly i dont know where to start all the light we cannot see is like no other book that ive read before on its surface this book is about a young german boy with a talent for fixing radios and a blind french girl who possesses a curiosity and courage way beyond her years both thrown helplessly into a world torn apart by war and devastation and the impact this has on their lives but this book is so much more than that it is about survival love courage family friendship etc but on a deeper level it is also a study on human nature and what it means to do what is expected versus do what is rightthe author anthony doerr has a masterful way with words the richness in detail with which he describes every character event scene in the book paints a vivid picture of what life was like in the midst of war yet he does so in a manner that does not take away from the story itself he does not bog the story down with long tedious paragraphs or pages and pages of detailed description that make readers like me want to just skip ahead to the actual story and not bother with the details instead he uses brevity as a powerful tool in just a few words short phrases sometimes not even complete sentences he is able to bring to life not only his characters and the situations they encounter but also draw the reader into their world to experience it for ourselves as i was reading i actually felt like i was being transported back to that time period mid s to s walking alongside the characters seeing what they were seeing feeling what they were feeling the atrocities of war described in the book were very harsh and very real despite this being a work of fiction i actually winced during some of the parts where an atrocity was being described and had to set the book aside for a few minutes to calm myself ive read other books in the past about his time period about world war ii and the atrocities of war but none of those books had the impact this one did thinking about it now i realize why those books either use wwii merely as a backdrop without going into much detail or if they do the events are portrayed in a way that makes it feel like a story or a recounting of history as a reader you are told what happened during that time period but dont really feel a connection to it this book in its uniqueness actually makes you live that history rather than just read about itthe other unique aspect to this book was the storyline involving the cursed stone which brought an unexpected element of suspense that still blended in perfectly with the rest of the story in the hands of a less capable author incorporating this part of the story might ruin the book entirely but with doerr this is definitely not the case he is consistent with the details as well as the storytelling and incorporates this arc seamlessly throughout the book i found myself at the edge of my seat at certain points wanting to find out what happens next whether the stone would be found whether certain characters would get caught etc i enjoyed this part of the book immenselymy only complaint about this book would be in its structure as the story is told in different timeframes and switches back and forth after every couple chapters this interrupted the flow a bit and did slow me down at times when reading since i had to go back and reread certain parts in order to remember where the previous timeframe left off it also caused a little bit of confusion for me initially with some of the characters who were already part of the story when the book opens but then are introduced for the first time when things switch back to the earlier timeframe then it picks up with what happens to that character from the later timeframe when it switches again not a showstopper by any means of course but i think the book wouldve been easier to get through if it didnt switch back and forth im pretty sure there was significance to structuring the book this way but unfortunately it was lost on medespite this long review that i just wrote i actually dont feel like i did this book any justice in fact no review can do this book much justice because it is a book that cant just be described you basically have to read and experience it for yourself for me personally i loved this book and i know this is a story that will stay with me for a long time to come i can totally see why this book won a pulitzer prize absolutely welldeservedread in january,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,excellent,5,hoping the show is as good as the book one of the best books ive read in years the sympathetic views of the germans may not be so popular but the book shows the humanity of both groups of individuals,positive
all the light we cannot see a novel,brilliant,5,i did not read this book i inhaled it if i could give it stars i would there is a reason it won the pulitzer actually there are many,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,this is not a hero story,5,starsamazon delivered my copy early so im going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one pardon if this winds up sounding like an english paper i have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that i feel like i should have read this in schoolnote im writing this review with the express belief that you reader have at least read the book description otherwise why are you reading this reviewi want to start this off by saying two things one this is not a hero story snow is never once in my opinion shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero hes no luke skywalker or redeemed villain this isnt some sob backstory to explain why the bad guy is bad this is yet another set of layers to the onion that is snowsecond this book is dark its been a minute since i read the original trilogy but i swear it wasnt quite as graphic as this book was cannibalism is mentioned and its showntalked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it one character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded another is also gruesomely displayed after their death several characters are dragged through processions to prove a point another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun multiple accounts of vomitingpoison throughout and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human lifenonspoilery reviewthis book makes you think a lot it makes you question things and wonder if maybe snow is right hes not but its written in such a way that hes not a villain donald sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that snow isnt a villain hes just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piecehe does it so well and he doesnt think hes a bad person he thinks its the only way society can survive and whether you think hes right or wrong he doesnt think hes bad he likes himselfthis should be the mantra for this book snow is a conflicting flawed human in our society hes evil a sociopath or a psychopath hes a murderer and a killer hes a bad guy in his world hes one of the masses he simply lives as hes been raised to with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the districts and the capitol hes simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the hard decisionsregardless of the other characters in this theyre all props to his storywhich fits well with the snow we know from the hunger games everyone is second stage to snow and his life this is his evolution from being a child to a man to becoming the snow we know and lovehatei definitely dont think this book is for everyone im sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she cant wait to read it and i dont think shell like it at all and shes a diehard thg trilogy fan why because not everyone likes to read depressing books theres no redemption in this theres no saving someone from themselves this is the fall stumble plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fullyso take that as you will full spoilers below about everythingps this is a standalonespoilers belowokay so i was worried about this book when i read the first chapter sample and it got announced that snow would be training the district girl i thought oh crap its gonna be a cliche ya its gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap and yeah it did that and up until the last pages i was teetering on a stars and then oh boy the endlucy grey was a sweet girl but she felt off since the beginning i still cant fully put my finger on it but her and snows relationship felt so iwrongi the entirety of the book the red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his and even so far as to say she was his property and thats all kinds of wrong and even though their romance was cute and fluffy it felt bad tainted you knew something was going to happen it always does in these villain backstories usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then theyre like whelp guess ill just be evilnot in this booksnow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this should he turn in his friend to the capitol because theyre colluding with rebels and could tear down the flawed infrastructure or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing is the hunger games wrong or good is it wrong to view the district people as second class humans and so on this book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole districtcapitol thing youve always known there was a divide between them but in this you really see how much the capitol looks down on the districts and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time katniss first enters the hunger gamesbut i digress snow struggles with morality but hes flawed and very very imperfect he rationalizes every death he takes as selfdefense or some other reason when really hes just murdered someone because its inconvenient for him he kills or at least removes her from the picture its ambiguous lucy grey in the end because shes a loose end and too free he does it not someone else not some freak accident he chooses to do it and by the time it happens you already know what direction hes headed in so its not quite another nail in the coffin it fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wantsall the nods to thg characters and names was cool you also had a lot of the great gatsby vibes in the old money versus new money mentality that a lot of the capitol had with district people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the capitol life theyre looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trashyou saw a lot of the evolution in the hunger games and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what katniss and peeta suffered through you see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thingyou also see a side of the capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogysuffering a lot of the book shows snow struggling with having been a small child living through the dark days and the war he was when the capitol won and even then it was hard you learn about the hell the capitol lived through as they were besieged by the districts army and forced to ration starvation and cannibalism its a hard picture and its so blatantly told collins didnt hold back any punches in this i never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader but it was definitely that for the story and it made sense regardless of the capitol not being at war with the districts anymore the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events so when one mentor gets killed by her tribute they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentors funeral its disgusting debasing and shows how much the capitol views the districts as nothing more than rodents or livestockanyway ill stop talking go read it yourself its a hard read a heavy read but it was very very enjoyable,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,ted bundy coriolanus and the joker,5,the ballad of songbirds and snakesas most readers already know this prequel explores coriolanuss life when he was a teenager the opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for lucy gray who was from the despised district but what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer lucy gray learned how to work a situation to her advantagein the beginning the tributes did not enjoy capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed its a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foodsthe problem was that watching too much brutality turned the capitol away from the games snows addition to the hunger games of costumes interviews and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy this should be a cautionary talea lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make in the opening of this book theres a quote by hobbeshereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe they are in that condition which is called warre and such a warre as is of every man against every man thomas hobbes leviathan coriolanuss first lesson to be molded into the future oppressor was during the hunger games when he was forced to go in the arena to get out sejanus one of the mentors who was not supposed to be in there while at the hospital getting stitches the head gamekeeper dr gaul asked if coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learnwithout the threat of death it wouldnt have been much of a lesson said dr gaul what happened in the arena thats humanity undressed the tributes and you too how quickly civilization disappears all your fine manners education family background everything you pride yourself on stripped away in the blink of an eye revealing everything you actually are a boy with a club who beats another boy to death thats mankind in its natural statei think i wouldnt have beaten anyone to death if you hadnt stuck me in that arena he retortedyou can blame it on the circumstances the environment but you made the choices you made no one else its a lot to take in all at once but its essential that you make an effort to answer that question who are human beings because who we are determines the type of governing we need later on i hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonighta very similar thought process was also stated by the joker in the dark nightto them youre just a freak like me they need you right now but when they dont theyll cast you out like a leper you see their morals their code its a bad joke dropped at the first sign of trouble theyre only as good as the world allows them to be ill show you when the chips are down these these civilized people theyll eat each other see im not a monster im just ahead of the curveboth the joker and dr gaul has distorted thinking its one thing to make a choice freely and its quite another thing to be forced into onehuman nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppressionlater as coriolanuss feelings toward lucy gray grew he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district sejanus joined him there soon aftersejanus was never one who was comfortable with the capital and its way of life he got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north out of panemcoriolanus found out about sejanus plot mayfair threatens to tell her father the mayor everything which would implicate coriolanus and lucy gray despite them being only bystanders he shot hersejanus is charged with treason and hanged and lucy gray baird is the main suspect in billy taupe her ex rebel boyfriend and mayfairs deaths as he left her for the mayors daughterin desperation lucy gray decides to join the rebels up north and coriolanus decides to go with her thinking theres nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were foundbut as they prepare to flee district snow gets paranoid that lucy gray is betraying him when they stop at a house near district s lake he discovers the rebels store of the weapons when lucy gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him inwhat if they interrogated or even tortured her the story would come out she hadnt killed anyone he had his word against hersbut even though snow searches for her lucy gray was nowhere to be foundthe three killings that snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and ptsd coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute bobbin in the hunger games arena he also shoots the mayors daughter and also turns in his best friend sejanus for treason resulting in his executionlucy gray was the last straw for his sanity back at the capital the reader sees snows change to the dark sidesometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently but it would never have worked out between them even if hed stayed they were simply too different and he didnt like love the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable if he ever married hed choose someone incapable of swaying his heart someone he hated even so they could never manipulate him the way lucy gray had never make him feel jealous or weak livia cardew would be perfect he imagined the two of them the president and his first lady presiding over the hunger games a few years from now hed continue the games of course when he ruled panem people would call him a tyrant ironfisted and cruel but at least he would ensure survival for survivals sake giving them a chance to evolve what else could humanity hope for really it should thank himthis happened to ted bundy as i believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him if you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriendrejection is a powerful force in a persons life if they are not stable dr gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,a fantastic villain origin story,5,i adored the hunger games series dystopian ya is not a normal genre for me but this series is awesome and this prequel a fantastic villain origin storycoriolanus snow is an ambitious yearold student whose wealthy family barely survived the war he is all about image and pretense which often vie against his normal human feelings his parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin tigrisbut the th hunger games is to be the first one with mentors and coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from district while at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district he quickly realizes that lucy gray is someone who could win and its up to him to figure out how to help her do that along the way coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bringas he works his way through the games he also discovers who wields the power in the capitol who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the massesthe student mentors also have a say in how the games are run and in a somewhat twisted sort of way their professor gives assignments and in coriolanus essays we see how future games come about and evolve as the mentors talk about the games and what is happening we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind they view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the games really are at the same time we see that those in the capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebelsthe hunger games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery this book however was almost more black and gray in its imagery what with the rubble of the arena and the capitol still trying to rebuild from the war that made the contrast of lucy grays colorful skirt and the snakes all the more strikingas with the rest of the series we see the government oppression we see the results of war and rebellion we see society broken but fighting and we see that even with survival life isnt grand and colorful but we also see that the human spirit is strongno one likes who president snow becomes and i think writing about his story so that he gains the readers sympathy is brilliant the story isnt fastpaced but it drew me in and kept me enthralled,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,an authors initial perspective on the ballad of songbirds and snakes,5,as a ya dystopian author i wanted to learn from the best so i purchased this book on my birthday just a day after i published my own dystopian bookthe hunger games series sparked my passion for writing so this book holds a special place in my heart but i knew i had to let go of that bias because this is an entirely new thing i need to read this not as a reader but as an author so i approached this book with a careful eye just like any other character who approaches a jabberjay in the seriesthe perspective of the ballad of songbirds and snakes isnt new to me simply because its from the villains voice its new in a way as it explores the coming of age tale of coriolanus snows cleverly paranoid overthinking mindi knew what will happen to coriolanus snow so i gripped my seat as i approved in my kindle oasis it was simply impossible i dont see anything bad from happening i asked myself how will suzanne collins end thisand she didand i couldnt believe itit was so captivating that i couldnt put it down i will not put any spoilers here but i just want to say inevitable as the sunrise betrayals leave behind a trail of destruction for the snake snow will always fall,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,quite the read,5,i have such mixed emotions after finishing this book but first of all this book is absolutely incredible i honestly think it might be my favorite book of the hg series and ms collins absolutely does not disappoint with her writing and content getting to read about panem and thus the beginning of the hg was so gratifying and the way this story flowed into and matched up with the trilogy was absolutely flawless truly it is excellentnow its kind of rare to read a book when the protagonist is the villain we all clearly know from the hg trilogy that president snow is a pretty terrible person yet reading this book from his point of view its easy to forget that but its also fascinating to see how he thinks of himself and sees his own actions along that same thought snow is very charismatic and definitely knows how to work the people around him to get what he wants or to present himself in a way that will clearly benefit himself often at the cost of someone elseminor spoiler the other part of snows life that i do find incredibly sad while he definitely has poor character traits to begin with he was also very manipulated by several people around him which i think added considerably to how he turned out as an adult and very much shaped his viewpoint and his creation of the gamesso definitely worth the read and reread this book is very thoughtprovoking even from outside the dystopian viewpoint there are a lot of reflections on who we are as humans as groups societies on the roles of government and the rights of its citizensfor the many pages it reads quickly hope you enjoy it as much as i did,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,if you love the hunger games buy this book,5,ok i was skeptical on getting this book but i have to say after reading it i absolutely love it i always wanted to know about snow and how he came to be the way he was in the books this book explains it all i am one of those that read the hunger games at least once a year im telling you right now this is going to be in the lineup itll probably be the first book that i read i love learning about his cousin and then remembering that she ended up in the hunger games as well the names of the kids that went to school with him im just saying it is a good read it is one of those that you dont want to put it down enjoy the book have fun and may the odds be ever in your favor,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,the ballad of songbirds and snakes,5,i was skeptical about this book keeping my interest it is a prequel which usually at least gives a few kernels that make the original trilogy a deeper experiencei was wrong like really wrong collins always delivers and this book is a testament to her talent there are more than a few kernels to be mined here the title itself is quite clever as this is lucy grays story tooi cant say more nor list any topic specifically without spoilers i can say we watch the evolution of a capitolborn citizen trying for a better life to the man who would become president of panemncv,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,great addition to the series,4,the ballad of songbirds and snakes by suzanne collins is a captivating and original addition to the hunger games series this prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the hunger games and explores the complex character of coriolanus snow who later becomes president snow giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded the story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the hunger games world offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy while it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books it compensates with its rich character development and thoughtprovoking themes and the lack of action makes sense given the setting and novelty of the hunger games at that point this novel is a mustread for fans of the hunger games series as it adds depth and complexity to a world we thought we knew so well making it an enthralling and thoughtprovoking experience from start to finish though the openending was a little confusing to me,positive

night night,should be required reading,5,this book needs to be read by everyone especially in light of what is happening at the present i read this book several years ago but see its relevance at this critical time we have forgotten and need to be reminded and those who are ignorant of the great atrocities that humankind did to the jews need to be informed may our young people read and use their critical thinking skills to understand,positive

night night,the gift of my personal holocost,5,this book of elies was the most impactful piece of literature since i read uncle toms cabin as a twelve year old child many years ago i am now years of age and living in a retirement community in west seattle i was totally absorbed in elie weasels account of his horrific experience in several concentration camps as a sixteen year old adolescent as if i were experiencing the same dynamic in my old age stripped of most of my self defining gifts and abilities as i live with post polio syndrome and the effects of a a stroke years ago i am so blessed with a life that gifts me loving friends and family and abundant provision for all my basic needs and then some i will be listening for my calling to provide solace to this suffering world,positive
night night,mentioned that mendesfrance was suffering like jesus elie wiesel responded,5,elie wiesels night shedding light upon the darknesselie wiesels holocaust memoir night new york hill and wang translated by marion wiesel is one of the bestknown and most highly acclaimed work about the holocaust the new york times called the edition a slim volume of terrifying power yet its power wasnt immediately appreciated in fact the book may have never been written had wiesel not approached his friend the novelist francois mauriac for an introduction to the french prime minister pierre mendesfrance whom he wanted to interview when mauriac a devoted catholic mentioned that mendesfrance was suffering like jesus elie wiesel responded in the heat of the moment that ten years earlier he had seen hundreds of jewish children suffer more than jesus did on the cross yet nobody spoke about their suffering mauriac appeared moved and suggested that wiesel himself write about it the young man took his friends advice he began writing in yiddish an page manuscript about his experiences of the holocaust the central union of polish jews in argentina published in yiddish an abbreviated version of this book under the title and the world remained silent wiesel later translated the text into french he called it more simply and symbolically night la nuit and sent it to mauriac who helped wiesel find a publisher the literary and small publishing house les editions de minuit and wrote its preface the english version published in by arthur wang of hill and wang received strong critical acclaim despite initially modest sales elie wiesels eloquent and informed interviews helped bring the difficult subject of the holocaust to the center of public attention by oprah winfrey selected night for her highprofile book club further augmenting its exposurethis work is definitely autobiographicalan eloquent memoir documenting wiesels family sufferings during the holocaustyet due to its literary qualities the text has been also read as a novel or fictionalized autobiography the brevity poignant dialogue almost lyrical descriptions of human degradation and suffering and historical accuracy of this multifaceted work render night one of the most powerful holocaust narratives ever writtenelie eliezer wiesel was only years old when the nazis entered sighet in march of a small romanian town in northern transylvania which had been annexed to hungary in at the directives of adolf eichmann who took it upon himself to cleanse hungary of its jews the situation deteriorated very quickly for the jewish population of sighet and other provincial towns within a few months between may and july approximately hungarian jews mostly those living outside of budapest were deported to auschwitz aboard trainswiesels entire familyhis father chlomo his mother sarah and his sisters tzipora hilda and beatricesuffered this fate among them only elie and two of his sisters hilda and beatrice managed to survive the holocaust however since the women and the men were separated at auschwitz upon arrival elie lost track of what happened to his sisters until they reunited after the war in the concentration camps father and son clung to each other night recounts their horrific experiences which included starvation forced labor and a death march to buchenwald being older and weaker chlomo becomes the target of punishment and humiliation hes beaten by ss officers and by other prisoners who want to steal his food weakened by starvation and fatigue he dies after a savage beating in january sadly only a few weeks before the americans liberated the concentration camp throughout their tribulations the son oscillates between a paternal sense of responsibility towards his increasingly debilitated father and regarding his father as a burden that might cost him his own life elie doesnt dare intervene when the ss officer beats chlomo fearing that he himself will become the next victim if he tries to help his father in the darkness and despair of night the instinct of selfpreservation from moment to moment counteracts a lifetime of familial love even when elie discovers the death of his father in the morning he experiences through a sense of absence not only his fathers absence as his bunk is now occupied by another inmate but also the lack of his own human response i did not weep and it pained me that i could not weep but i was out of tears and deep inside me if i could have searched the recesses of my feeble conscience i might have found something like free at last night is offers a stark psychological account the process of human and moral degradation in inhumane conditions even the relatively few and fortunate survivors of the nazi atrocities such as elie became doubly victimized the victims of everything they suffered at the hands of their oppressors and the victims of everything they witnessed others suffer and were unable or perhaps more sadly unwilling to help although night focuses on the loss of humanity in the nazi concentration camps the authors life would become a quest for regaining it again in far better conditions if at least one condition is met caring about the suffering of others as wiesel explains to his audience on december during his acceptance speech of the nobel prize in oslo his message to his sonand his message to the world at largeis about the empathy required to keep the holocaust memory alive he reminds us all that i have tried to keep memory alive that i have tried to fight those who would forget because if we forget we are guilty we are accomplices we must take sides neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented claudia moscovici holocaust memory,positive
night night,some thoughts about night today,5,the risk inherent in writing about the holocaust is that todays readers have a hard time believing it those of us who did not experience the horrors of living in a nazi death camp cannot begin to understand what it was like battered women and severely abused children living today trapped in circumstances they cannot escape may come closebut most of us have no frame of reference nothing in our experience even remotely comparesthis i cant believe it mentality was also common among nonjewish civilians who lived in germany during the third reichwhen adolf hitler was in power even as night descended on wiesels little townsighet transylvania hungarythe jewish people could not believe what was happening moishe the beadle was deported by the hungarian police crammed into a cattle car and taken to a forest in poland to be executed with other jews incredibly moishe escaped and returned to sighet with his storythe train had stopped the jews were ordered to get off and onto waiting trucks the trucks headed toward a forest there everybody was ordered to get out they were forced to dig huge trenches when they had finished their work the men from the gestapo began theirs without passion or haste they shot their prisoners who were forced to approach the trench one by one and offer their necks moishes escape was a miracle he was wounded in the leg and left for dead in sighet he went from house to house telling his story but the people refused to listen even the young elie wiesel did not believe himthe denial continued in jewish families about to be transported to auschwitz the women were boiling eggs roasting meat preparing cakes sewing backpackswiesel does not challenge us to comprehend the gas chamber deaths of his mother and little sister tzipora instead he writes what we can grasp tzipora was holding mothers hand i saw them walking farther and farther away mother was stroking my sisters blond hair as if to protect her and i walked on with my father with the men i didnt know that this was the moment in time and the place where i was leaving my mother and tzipora foreverwiesel describes with remarkable restraint a vicious beating he receives from a kapo i felt the sweat running down my back a i stepped forward a crate he ordered they brought a crate lie down on it on your belly i obeyed i no longer felt anything except the lashes of the whip one two he was counting he took his time between lashes only the first really hurt i heard him count ten eleven his voice was calm and reached me as through a thick wall twentythree two more i thought half unconscious the kapo was waiting twentyfour twenty five it was over listen to me you son of a swine said idek coldly so much for your curiosity you shall receive five times more if you dare tell anyone what you saw understood i nodded once ten times endlessly as if my head had decided to say yes for all eternityelie wiesels magnificent night bridges that enormous gulf between i cant believe it and the mindnumbing horrific sinking in of the realization of oh dear god this really happened his account is straightforward almost matteroffact with a minimum of frenzy inordinate dwelling on flames of infernos prolonged death throes or metaphysical discourses about evilhe does talk about his relationship with god throughout the ordeal and of course about his father who was with him in auschwitz and buchenwaldwhy did wiesel write this book he tells usthere are those who tell me that i survived in order to write this text i am not convinced i dont know how i survived i was weak rather shy i did nothing to save myself a miracle certainly not if heaven could or would perform a miracle for me why not for others more deserving than myself it was nothing more than chance however having survived i needed to give some meaning to my survival in retrospect i must confess that i do not know or no longer know what i wanted to achieve with my words i only know that without this testimony my life as a writeror my life periodwould not have become what it is that of a witness who believes he has a moral obligation to try to prevent the enemy from enjoying one last victory by allowing his crimes to be erased from human memory i am grateful for this book and for marion wiesels excellent and sensitive translation of her husbands memoir some great literature has come out of the holocaust in my opinion elie wiesels night is the best book and certainly one of the most deeply moving among these worksarlene sanders,positive

night night,matter of fact horrors,5,night was among the first widely read accounts of a holocaust concentration camp survivor it was originally over eight hundred pages in yiddish weisel worked with the material rewriting and editing it first into a two hundred forty five page version published in argenitina then into a one hundred seventy page version published in france night reached its final form with its one hundred sixteen page publication in in english in the united states wiesel declares that every word of the work is true and he describes night as his testimony critics tend to feel that the basis for the work is factual but that wiesels long and meticulous rewrite and editing has transformed what would have been simple fact into a work of art open to a variety of understandings whatever the case the englishlanguage publication was among the first widely read personal accounts of the holocaust and it continues to draw both readers and praise to the present daythe book is written in an unexpectedly matter of fact tone and lacks any trace of selfpity as such it has an quality that is very difficult to define one in which most human emotion seems to have been burned away by the experiences the writer endured elie wiesel was born in in sighet a fairly large town first claimed by romania and later by hungary wiesel writes that he was a studious boy deeply religious and the son of respected people they had heard rumors of how jews were treated by germans but the war seemed very far away and the stories were incredible to themeven when they were told by a man well known to the jewish community the process was fairly slow with jews forced to wear the star of david prohibited from this and that and finally forced to live in two ghettos in the city then in may the jews of sighet were deported to auschwitz wiesel was sixteen at the time he would spend about year in various camps before arriving at buchenwald where he was liberated by allied forces in when he saw himself in a mirror for the first time since his incarceration he was horrified by the reflection which seemed to be that of a living corpsethe book has an abrupt and episodic nature but most of it focuses on wiesels relationship with his father schlomo wiesel and how the two men successfully stayed together during their time in the camps and how the two men less successfully attempted to care for each other although night is filled with horrors the ultimate one occurs when the grinding hell of the camp system causes wiesel to reject feeling for his father as a hinderance to his own survival wiesel is also prompted to question god and whether god exists and if so how god can accept the nazis systematic destruction of the jews as one individual cynically comments to wiesel in night he believes in hitlerbecause hitler has kept every promise he ever made to the jewsthere are moments of light scattered in the workstars in the darknessa frenchwoman who risks herself to encourage wiesel a friend whose dying act is a gift of musicbut for the most part night is night indeed and there is no escape for all its brevity it is painful to read difficult to grasp and incredibly frightening in the ordinary tone in which it is told the book is published with a preface by wiesel a forward by francois mauriac and the text of wiesels speech in acceptance of the nobel peace prize strongly recommendedgft amazon reviewer,positive
night night,witness to unspeakable horrors of the holocaust,5,this moving memoir is a raw firsthand account of the horrors of the holocaust covering a time period of elie wiesel first recounts his life as a young jewish boy living in a small town in hungary despite the aggression of the nazis elies family felt themselves to be relatively safe because of the distance from the other german occupied areas and because they were sure that the war would be over before any harm could come to them had they been able to foresee the future they would have taken advantage of an opportunity they had to emigrate to palestine but by the unthinkable happened gradually at first in a series of escalating indignities jews lost their rights to conduct business to own jewels and were forced to wear yellow stars while living in ghettos all the while elies family remained hopeful that the war would be over soon not until the transport out of town was announced did they realize the precariousness of their situation but even then and in the cattle cars they could not have anticipated the sheer terror of the concentration camps and crematoria once they arrived in auschwitz elies memories are focused on his father and himself because he never saw his mother or sister again after they got off the train elie witnessed unspeakable atrocities such as hundreds of people forced to dig their own graves before being shot and babies being tossed alive into fires in trenches elie and his father were sentenced to hard labor and endured strenuous marches from camp to camp while trying to survive on one or two rations of soup and bread a day eventually elies father succumbed to malnutrition and dysentery in the midst of such misery elie pondered why he should even care to continue living after liberation by the americans elie happened to pass by a mirror for the first time in years he was stunned to see what he thought was a corpse staring back at him the whole book is quite disturbing but should be required reading so that the past mistakes of singling out a section of society by race color or creed to be the scapegoats for all evils must not be repeated,positive
night night,haunting and powerfully tragic,5,after reading night i realized that it is the first book ive read that was authored by a holocaust survivor i was so absorbed by elie weisels tale of absolute misery and despair that it only took me a little over an hour to read the entire book and ive found myself thinking about its contents ever since it is also the first book ive read that actually made me feel the authors painthe books starts with the feeling that germanys defeat was imminent weisel conveys a sense of complacency in that it appeared he and his family would be spared the worse with the red armys rapid westward advance to germany even when germany invades hungary in the spring of weisel and his family appeared content to wait for the russians this proved to be a grave miscalculation as the nazis begin deporting jews from the ghetto to labor camps in poland at this point weisel and his father are separated from his mother and younger sister the remainder of the book is about survival based on ingenuity fate and others misfortunes as he and his father trudge through the hell of auschwitz it isnt until later that weisel begins to assume the fate of his sister and motherthroughout the book death is both random and a frequent sight with the lines of people plodding to the chimneys that endlessly spew the ashes of thousands upon thousands a constant reminder of his inevitable fate weisel frequently contemplates his faith in god because there is no way he believes that god would allow such inhumanity on such a grand scale when the thundering artillery of the approaching red army are actually being felt the nazis crudely force the inmates of auschwitz on a death march to germany that only the strong could possibly survive at this point weisel sees and feels how the bonds of family become unglued when starvation becomes extreme and how the endless dead are unceremoniously disposed buchenwald is the final destination of the death march and it is there where weisel experiences his ultimate loss and eventual liberation by the americansat pages including a transcript of the authors nobel prize speech weisel didnt need many words to bring forth the pain suffering and loss he experienced and witnessed i found myself constantly putting myself in weisels shoes often wondering how he had the will at sixteen years of age to endure such horrific circumstances i intended to be critical of this book in that it left me with so many questions mainly followup questions like weisels thoughts looking back but with the book still making me think several days after i read it i accepted and appreciated night for what it was a nightmare that became reality for a teenager a capsule of that particular moment in time no more no less,positive
atomic habits an easy proven way to build good habits break bad ones,updated review after days building small yet lasting habits,5,i previously wrote this review right after reading the book today february th after applying jamess system for days on a few tiny habits i feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely workedi will divide the review into parts the first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes next i hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits following that i will share how i implemented the first habits throughout these months then some thoughts to whom i would recommend reading the book last there are complementary readingssummaryintroduction james starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school that event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order coming to the conclusion that we all deal with setbacks but in the long run the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits with the same habits you will end up with the same results but with better habits anything is possiblesection i the fundamentalschapter here we learn the power of compounding effect changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years james explains that breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions which build up the potential required to unleash a major change comparing to habits he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost feet into the air in a few weeks from that perspective we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayedchapter based on a layer concentric circle behavior change modeldivided into outcome change process change and identity changejames explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs assumptions and values many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve this leads us to outcomebased habits the alternative is to build identitybased habits with this approach we start by focusing on who we wish to become the strongest changes then happen from inside out starting from our identity passing through the process and ultimately changing the outcomechapter in this chapter we are introduced to a step framework which is composed of cue craving response and reward james calls it the laws of behavior change he then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behaviorwhen the levers are in the right positions they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position it is nearly impossible through examples he explains that the cue triggers a craving which motivates a response which provides a reward which satisfies the craving and ultimately becomes associated with the cue together they create a habit loop that when repeated many times habits become automaticsection ii make it obviouschapter a primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes once our habits become so common the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded if we want to create better habits a good idea is to be aware of the cues james finishes up by sharing a strategy called habits scorecarda simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis we first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and once we have a full list we score each habit as an effective ineffective or neutral habit besides noticing what is actually going on we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to bechapter the cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms and the most common cues are time and location when we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit we are more likely to follow through stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage an example when building a daily journaling habit would be after i pour my cup of coffee each morning i will journal for minuteschapter this chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors given that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior to build good habits then we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old oneschapter one of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it as james points out it is easier to avoid temptation than resist itsection iii make it attractivechapter james explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is the more likely it is to become habitforming every behavior that is highly habitforming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine it is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive the strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to dochapter we tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe that said it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents peers and colleagues there is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe and finally we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves one of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behaviorchapter to avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive habits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelingssection iv make it easychapter all habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior a process known as automaticity automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over the key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit not much for how long we have been practicing itchapter since every action requires a certain amount of energy we are motivated to do what is easy by contrast the more energy required the less likely it is to occur you dont actually want the habit itself what you really want is the outcome the habit delivers the greater the obstacle the more friction there is between you and your desired end state that is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easierchapter there are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day as james puts these decisive moments are a fork in the road sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one to avoid procrastination the skill of showing up says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps making it as easy as possible to take action a new habit should not feel like a challenge the actions that follow can be challenging but the first minutes should be easy what you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path he calls it the twominute rule meaning that new habits should take less than minutes to do in the beginning once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer detailschapter in order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place there are interesting strategies to improve our future behavior make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future james gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served if however he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half that would never happen make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter unsubscribing from unwanted emails moving to a friendlier neighborhood buying a standing desk or setting up automatic bill paysection v make it satisfyingchapter we should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time the human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards for that we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the longrunchapter here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits the immediate satisfaction it deliversas mentioned earlier in chapter is one of the many benefits that standout besides that james says when we get a signal that we are moving forward we become more motivated to continue down that path the most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an x each time we stick with our routine one of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows if you miss one day try to get back into it as quickly as possible the first mistake is never the one that ruins you it is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows missing once is an accident missing twice is the start of a new habit this is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers anyone can have a bad performance a bad workout or a bad day at work but when successful people fail they rebound quicklychapter in order to prevent bad habits andor eliminate unhealthy behaviors james says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful a habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability it is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you dont follow through then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with yousection vi advanced techniqueschapter we learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the longrun is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills james proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughlychapter when we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest the goldilocks rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities not too hard not too easy just rightchapter one downside of certain habits james explains is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors to counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance using a simple chart to convey his message we learn that the process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalizedpersonal thoughtsreading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details in the meantime i thought about simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits let me share these strategies here with you and in the following section i will describe how i managed to cultivate the first new habits upon reading the bookfollowing the system proposed by james together with these strategies the first strategy is about determining a commitment time frame to avoid excuses during this initial trial period a month time frame is a fair commitment choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month just at the end of the period i will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons the next one is to choose only new habit each month in doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose last during the first month of any new habit i noticed that if i spend time exploring the details and the benefits my motivation stays high it doesnt only help us create better practices but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives podcasts articles videos books online courses tutorials and blog posts are all good sourcesimplementation of new habitsnov i had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened although i have carried a notebook with me for quite a while it has never worked as a real journala daily routine when we sit down and write personal thoughts intentions and reflections at around the same time instead it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings to write down ideas and thoughts to express travel memories and to doodle today after months i havent looked back once and still cant believe it took me that long to start this daily habit during the first month i read blog posts watched videos and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativitydec i have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement although yoga has been a special part of my life since i was i hadnt given proper attention to handstands but now after months practicing it every day it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis again i definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method this is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoyjan by now we know the benefits of cold showersranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world i had previously taken cold showers for months in but it was a goal mindset instead of a habit mindset after that trial i set aside and although i have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then i wished cold showers was the default mode now after month i cant see myself taking warm showers after all it is about intention again we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories one of my inspirations was wim hof it isnt comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day but after minutes both my breath and thoughts calm downputting them together these habits dont take more than minutes of my day while i spend about minutes journaling and more minutes practicing handstands i save minutes taking cold showers because i wont stay any longer than necessaryrecommendation first if you have watched videos listened to podcasts read articles and books on habit formation and after all that you feel satisfied then please save your money and time however if you are like me that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life feel that there is still room for improvement this book can be a terrific addition last if you havent spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones please read this bookcomplementary readings game changers by dave asprey exposed me to a wealth array of ideashabitstools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next the book is divided into laws essentialism by greg mckeown helped me focus on less but more important tasks giving clarity to what matters most this is especially interesting to break bad habits the talent code by daniel coyle brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices finding our ignition identity and having the right coach to guide us genuinely i read it many years ago then a few years back i read his following book called the little book of talentwhich is perhaps even more to the point the systems view of life by fritjof capra enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated it is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement atomic habits especially to tie together the step framework into the feedback loop systemi sincerely hope you too have fun while building new habitstake carehaical,positive

atomic habits an easy proven way to build good habits break bad ones,atomic habits will change your life takeaways,5,atomic habits by james clear is one of those rare books that i immediately read twice in a row it is filled with dozens of sciencebacked and actionable nuggets of wisdom do you want to improve any habits in your life i heartily recommend atomic habits to you we are all driven by our habits many of which are unconscious below are quotes and takeaways from this lifechanging book getting percent better every day counts for a lot in the longrun atomic habits explains why the little things you do every day matters your little habits matter it may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind but it is a big deal imagine if you improved your habits by only every day youd be dramatically a different person in a year then imagine if you let your habits decline by every day youd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now your little habits atomic habits count for a lot in the long run what little habits are you improving upon or neglecting today you do not rise to the level of your goals you fall to the level of your systems this is such an important point in the book oftentimes we focus on goals in our life while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals as an example i had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon he achieved this goal and then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape he was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy goal achievement can actually set us back if we dont get set up sustainable systems get the systems right and then well indeed also achieve our goals systems goals every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become no single instance will transform your beliefs but as the votes build up so does the evidence of your new identity i love this quote from the book every action every habit you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become do you want to be a more organized person when you develop habits and systems that organize your life you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person you think to yourself hey im an organized person and then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions a virtuous cycle the flip side of this can be true too what if you often show up late to meetings youre casting votes that may make you think well im just a person that is always late an unvirtuous cycle be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and indeed who you truly are how long does it actually take to form a new habit you just need to get your reps in atomic habits answers the question of how much time does it take to form a new habit with a better answer of x number of actions meaning you may need to simply complete a new habit times for it to stick which could be done in days or weeks or months depending on the new habit it is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action versus trying to stick to a habit for just x number of days get your reps in reduce friction decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits the inverse of this is also true increase friction between you and your bad habits i think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy i need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work and i need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office out of sight out of mind in sight and i eat it which of course reminds me of the dad joke i often tell my girls im on a seafood diet i see food and i eat it use temptation bundling pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do this is a powerful concept i put this in practice by only watching tv when im on the treadmill i am able to run at a mph pace and watch tv or videos on the ipad when im on a treadmill so i generally only watch sporting events or movies or s music videos on youtube when im running on the treadmill this approach actually allows me to run longer if i want to watch a full half of a game for example and s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action youre already taking stack them together ie habit stacking use a habit tracker keep track of your habit streak and dont break the chain atomic habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success what gets measured gets managed one of my favorite habit trackers is a fitbitapple watch which tracks steps heart rate sleep weight and can even track food intakecalories if you input this data my behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers atomic habits gives you additional habit tracker resources never miss twice when you forget to do a habit make sure you get back on track immediately we all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse well thats okay for one day dont let it happen twice get back on track as soon as possible and yes sometimes we miss a habit two days in row just dont let it become three days author james clear gets to the point quickly in atomic habits and with actionable advice james has been blogging about habits health happiness creativity and productivity since check out a sampling of his writing at his website james is also fun to follow on twitter atomic habits has relatively short chapters that open with compelling stories and end with helpful chapter summaries if you listen to books on audible i highly recommend the audio book as james reads this book very passionately,positive

the laws of power,a self defense weapon book that is needed,5,the laws of power not sure where to really begin but for people that say it is an evil book you are taking it the wrong way it is a powerful self defense book needed because it literally teaches you how to deal with people out there in the world that are negative toxic liars flatterers fake angry suspicious murderers and many more to go into in depth detail of the book here is how it is mainly summed upyou come across a law it says what it is you then read a transgression or observance of the law which these are real historical stories that you will be reading some of these stories are cruel fascinating and overall jaw dropping youll find some of the worlds most recognized leaders and influencers in these storiesafter you read these stories or the story the author gives you an interpretation which is basically the breakdown or meaning of what the law was taking place in the story after reading the interpretation once i highly recommend going back to read the story again this way youll gain an even more deeper understanding of the lawlastly the author leaves you with an image an authority which this is a quote by someone and a reversal the reversal is basically the conclusion and tells you why you should follow the lawafter you read a law have a highlighter with you and go back to highlight some of the most important words or quotes trust me a lot of things will really stick out to you really reflect on your own past personal experiences or situations youve been in with others you want to do this because itll help make you stronger wiser and more prepared than ever before when you come across any situation or person in the future because you will we all will and i strongly feel that this is why robert greene wrote the laws of power not just so you can be powerful or controlling over everyone but mainly how you gain or use power against those who are very dangerous and want to purposely put you down into the groundthis book is not a toy and dont just think that after you are done with the book you can immediately just go out and start practicing all the laws that is not how it works it is your responsibility to know what situation you are in and to know what law will be your bodyguard nevertheless you should always be extremely careful of your own actions and the words that you are going to say power should never be underestimated you must learn to handle it with care if not handled carefully its like letting loose a tiger out of its cage and its killing everyone in sightread at your own risk but most importantly learn,positive
the laws of power,danger read at your own risk,4,there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book so if you are curious but unsure this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book and how it will impact youfirst to understand the laws of power you must know two key ideas you can not escape the power game thinking you can not participate is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still robert greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples the laws of power are neither good nor evil they are just laws if someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise this is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this bookthings i liked new paradigmafter reading the laws you will never see the world the same way again once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before increases powerone of the main reasons to buy the book you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these lawscrystal clearevery law is clearly outlined with transgression of the law observance of the law keys to power and a reversalgreat storiesthe laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstractwhat i didnt likeriskyan old proverb says a man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten if you begin to use the laws improperly you could get yourself in some dangerous situations lose friends piss off a lot a people and destroy relationships requires discernmentif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says do xyz and you will accomplish vyx look elsewhere the laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and applynot for everyone if you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with cautionoverall if you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do you should definitely read the laws of power by robert greene if you want to be naive easily manipulated weak you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilxthanks for reading,positive
the laws of power,uncomfortable but important read,5,ive heard about this book here and there but i havent gotten around to check it out until months ago i was most intrigued when i heard that this book iswas allegedly banned in prisons due to its very powerful insights and tactics so i pulled the trigger and purchased the bookwith that being said i think this is an essential read for every adult was it a pleasant read not necessarily it explores the dark aspects of our human nature and how power is at play in every social interaction a lot of the laws in this book didnt sit right with my personal values and it even made me uncomfortable at some points but that is not the point of this book because it equips you with the knowledge to protect yourself from subtle manipulations jealousy greed and other dangerous influences of those who surround youhighly recommend,positive
the laws of power,to sacrifice your wellbeing on the alter of getting ahead this is the book for you,5,if you want a stepbystep guide to everything that is wrong with your fellow human beings this is it the book treats all of life as adversarial as in for me to win you must lose the fact that it is successful tells the whole story why there is such disparity between the haves and havenots why we treat planet as a bottomless toilet and why religion an obvious fraud has such a hold on humanity if you want to sacrifice your wellbeing and relationships on the alter of getting ahead this is the book for you,positive
the laws of power,powerful book,5,the laws of power is a thoughtprovoking and insight book that delves into dynamics of power and how it can be effectively wielded each law is presented with historical examples and anecdote making it an engaging read however it is important to approach this book with caution as some of the tactics described may seen as manipulative oe unethical overall the law of power offers valuable lessons on human behavior and power dynamics but it is up to the reader to decide how to apply them ethically in their own lives,positive
the laws of power,laws of power which dont make loads of sense at first so it has examples,5,i read all the laws and some of them dont really make immediate sense so it gives you a lot of historical and some more contemporary examples to help demystify some of the less straight forward ones its pretty easy to read and not really what i would refer to as complicated language more of probably early university level writing i wouldnt necessarily agree with all of the laws but some make a lot of sense,positive
the laws of power,do you want to feel like a baddie,5,reading this book has truly been a gamechanger for me before diving into its pages i felt like my life was out of control with challenges and setbacks lurking around every corner however this book has inspired me to take a new approach to life to view my obstacles and enemies not as barriers but as opportunities for growth and successone of the most impactful takeaways for me was learning how to harness the power of my enemies the author teaches us that having enemies isnt necessarily a bad thing in fact it can be quite beneficial our enemies can challenge us to be better to work harder and to reach higher they can inspire us to be our best selves even when we feel like giving upthrough reallife examples and powerful storytelling this book illustrates the ways in which we can turn our enemies into allies it provides practical tips and strategies for identifying and managing our enemies as well as shifting our mindset to view them in a positive lightoverall i would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to take control of their life and conquer their challenges its a powerful and inspiring read that will leave you feeling motivated empowered and ready to tackle anything that comes your way thank you to the author for sharing such an impactful message with the world,positive
the laws of power,solid,5,i like reading books involving psychology and this book is great with that touches on a lot of interesting ways people can interact with one another to get desired outcomes,positive
the laws of power,i hate reading,5,back in school i absolutely hated reading they provided value to me and books were mostly fictionthis book was recommended to me by my sales coach he said it was banned in prisonsi got curiousi havent even finished it yet im about to start the th lawthis book is straight up gold every single page there is something i didnt know most books have pages of information to take away every page i have read thus far is incredibly eyeopeningi use the first laws in my daytoday life right now im sure ill be using more as i continue reading itim using these laws for good its great for dealing with toxic people family disputes arrogant people people who dont like change people who are interviewing for new jobs people who are asking for raises people who are selling getting a girlfriendboyfriendin the wrong hands this book is bad for people with ill intentions please proceed to read this book with caution you have been warnedi will update my review once im finished with it,positive

lessons in chemistry a novel,chemical reaction retraction,4,much has been said about bonnie garmuss lessons in chemistry so when my sister chose it for our book club i was curious albeit cautiouslyelizabeth zott is a brilliant and beautiful chemist in midcentury california she seems to have everything going for her but seems is the operative word because the men she works with are awful whats more elizabeth isnt like other women or even people unflinchingly driven and uncompromising she refuses to perform for anyone to smile on demand or at all she tells the truth even when its ugly and it often is making her seem uncooperative unlikeable and cold to everyone but nobel prizenominated fellow odd duck calvin evans yet at her core elizabeth is purely kind despite having suffered loss violence and the most egregious sexual discrimination imaginable she believes that everyone deserves to be treated fairly and it is this humanity that she brings to her cooking show supper at sixnow if youre wondering how a nononsense chemist became a tv star then im right there with you suffice it to say that unjust events in elizabeths life resulted in this most unlikely of developments and although shes less than thrilled to be working with bowls instead of beakers she makes the show her own taking every opportunity to educate her female audience about not just cooking but chemistry and ultimately change subversive and surprisingly entertaining supper at six is a syndicated smash to me this is where elizabeth blossoms her paradoxically offputting personality passion for science and food and insatiable hunger for justice commingling to enable her to connect with other women its exciting and inspiring and all of the things but this is still lessons in chemistry not an uplifting romp about a reluctant but charismatic performer because as i said in the beginning elizabeth zott does not performtheres trouble brewing at the tv station just as there was at the lab only worse so some things happen and then some more things culminating in an ending that feels like a drop off a cliff and although i can see how it would be satisfying for most to me its anticlimactic still this isnt my story its elizabeth zotts shes a scientist first and in the end she gets what she wants and needsmaybe understanding and respecting that is a lesson that this very unscientific but very feminist reader needed to learn,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,i love this book,5,oh my god i love this book so so so much stars definitely i dont care what other reviewers say i love this book i read it for my book club im so glad i did i mean yes i agree with what some reviewers say it is sadly a fantasy the sad truth is that elizabeth zott the fmc would probably not have even been allowed to work in a scientific lab in the s let alone be on tv talking about chemistry yes it wasnt as laughoutloud as i thought it was gonna be particularly at the beginning with the rpe scene the sexism throughout the book that made me as a woman in my s now very angry and yes i do think it should have trigger warnings because of this and it didnt have as much romance as the appletv trailer made it seems yes i watched the trailer before reading the book sue me but i didnt see the actual show yet but it did make me laughoutloud in the middle had me smiling widely by the end of it it also has a very nice twist at the end im not gonna tell you what the twist was because that would be a major spoiler but anyway now im very much looking forward to seeing the appletv show comparing it with the book i would recommend,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,read the book,5,whatever you do if you are thinking of watching the television series do yourself a favor and read the book firstthis is a marvelously written accounting of the stereotypical mens world women had to endure in the s and s the content is brilliantly presented so that even someone who knows nothing about chemistry can easily follow along and become enamored by the science and the explanations that inspire you to learn more and wish there were women like elizabeth around when you were learning these topics be aware the story does have its dark sides and there are some triggering scenes early on the writing is presented well enough that you know whats coming so you can prepare yourself for the content the television series hads taken some liberties so if you want to know the magnitude of devotion and who elizabeth and calvin truly are read the book first overall i loved it and cant wait for what i hope will be future installments,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,a must read,5,i read this book when it first came out and liked it knowing that a show based on the book was going to be streaming i reread the book today in one long sitting i literally couldnt put it down ms garmus is eloquent in illustrating how male dominant society is and how women have been marginalized this was especially so in the s and s the time frame for the story elizabeth zott the protagonist in the story is a brilliant chemist whod unfairly been kicked out of graduate school had her scientific work stolen and plagiarized then fired from the research institute where shed worked a a lab technicianthe institute wouldnt deem to allow her to function as a research chemist she became a lover with a scientist at the institute who was killed in an accident before their daughter was born but she persevered hence the chemistry lessons disguised as a tv cooking program i just finished my nd reading,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,best book i have read in years,5,boy in someways im really angry that i read some of the reviews for this book some were ranting anbiut how negative it was about men some screaming feminist bs neither of those is true by the way i but then i was talking to someone when i was getting my haircut who was talking about this book and how much she enjoyed it and why and i thought what the heck ill try it i listen to the book on audible by the way fabulousthis is really unlike anything ive read in the last or years i loved this book i loved everything about it i loved all the characters men and women and especially the dog it was such a joy to read and i really hope that the author can come up with another book even half as good as this one is i have recommended this book to anyone who would listen for five minutes and bought one and sent it to my son if you only read one book this year let this be the one,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,this book everyone needs to read it immediately,5,i purchased this science period book yesterday which is not normally in my reading alerts due to a youtube video on the up coming show by the first chapter i could not put it down because never judge a book by its cover for one but two the resilience of elizabeththis wonderful work shows that what many should know women are capable of anything especially in the selizabeth zolt is someone many can relate to not only for her love of science but for the question when will someone take me seriously this wonderful work will leave you on the edge of what happens next im not going to give anything other away other than what ive already wrote i just wish there was a second book to go with this because wowwwww i love this book,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,not a bit overhyped,5,so often when you finally get around to reading a best seller that topped all the lists for almost a year you cant quite say what it lacked but it just doesnt live up to all the accolades this was definitely not one of those times bonnie garcia has written a book full of people you cate about grappling with the most interesting issues there are a few villains to be sure the issues are right at the forefront of the story elizabeth zott and calvin evans to say nothing of mad harriet walter wallet and ms franz will stay with you long after you leave them behind the cover of this well thought out novel,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,chemistry lessons and so much more,5,once i started reading this book i couldnt put it down this story tackles some big issues of the early s in a male dominated workforce sexism sexual abuse and operating outside the norm two social outcasts meet and a strong bond develops between them but they have to face the judgment and abuse of societyi loved the characters in this book they were well developed and full of unique personalities this group of misfits captured my heart an obsessed and brilliant scientist an unwed mother an unhappy housewife a precocious child a minister with an open mind a struggling single dad and an amazing dogthrough everything the story reminds us of the bonds we form and that we never know what someone is or has gone through this book could have been such a downer but thanks to the characters it was full of humor and hope this is a mustread,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,as if this book needs more hyperbolic praise,5,insert hyperbole here this book deserves every single gushing review thats accumulated i loved it as a year old mother i was a child on the tail end of the dying throes of the conformist s and i remember what it was even as late as the s to challenge the status quo was like belching everyone did it but it was never done in polite company this book takes the reader through the fight and fighting is painfulthis book enraged me frustrated me made me laugh out loud in many places especially when harriet first enters the story and it made me tear up in painful sorrow in sympathy and finally in happiness and it accomplished all this without angstget this book its worth every penny and you owe it to yourself to know that the events described in this book were fairly common back in the day make your daughters read this and make your sons learn this,positive
lessons in chemistry a novel,brilliantly written,5,this book captured me from the first sentence extraordinary character development with a refreshingly different story line the main characters singularlyscientific focus came across almost as aspergers sometimes which contributed even more to the story line while i did not like her atheistic viewpoint and criticism of god faith and religion i am a christian i compartmentalized it as a typical character trait for someone with a highly scientific mind i did not take it personally as some reviewers of this book have done after all its fiction i highly recommend it a great read,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,a fresh exciting sequel to the firm,5,just a couple of weeks ago i found out by chance that john grisham had written a sequel to his first massive best seller the firm i have read many of his books with the firm being my favorite i just reread it last year in fact so becoming reacquainted with mitch and abbey mcdeere again in the exchange was incredibly unexpected and excitingi used to be a huge grisham fan and have read many of his books but then i began to find his books had become stale and somewhat formulaic so i had stopped reading them but in the last few years i did read one of his more recent ones which was ok not brilliant but ok and i reread my two favorites of his the pelican brief and the firm so i was really pleasantly surprised that the exchange was outwhile i was cautious that it might be a letdown it was absolutely not that i was thoroughly engrossed in the story much like i was with many of grishams earlier books he knows how to write a pageturner like no other writer i know this book gets to a point where its hard to put down leaving the reader almost breathless while reaching the height of the story something he has done brilliantly time and again throughout his career but this isnt just a walk down the memory lane of the grishamofold he has updated the mcdeeres into their early s in so alas i am sure he is planning a third installment so the mcdeeres are not fresh young adults any longer but john grisham is not a fresh young writer any longer either instead he has matured his writingstyle to make his legal thriller style even betteri am now a reinvigorated eager fan of john grisham again it feels like i have reconciled with an old friend after a long absence good to see you again friend welcome back,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,sign me up for the threequel,4,the plot is set in the past around otherwise the mcdeeres would be pushing the firm was first published in the idea of the sequel works well throughout the book i was picturing a youthful tom cruise dashing around the world with jeanne tripplehorn the supportive wife holding down the fort at home could not really get the images out of my head a sequel is a great marketing idea also because all of us who enjoyed the first book avidly buy the second thankfully it built on the past rather than continually rehashing the firm the book is pretty good it does take a while to get going and does not start out as a page turner the chapter endings are not cliff hangers but by midway i was hooked and reading voraciously sign me up for the threequel,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,exciting scary interesting but i didnt like it,5,i didnt really like this book but for very selfish reasons that dont warrant a lower rating i read lots of books from plenty of genres but i love coming back to the familiar settings and writing style of the annual john grisham release this sequel to the firm which i enjoyed rereading in preparation remembered none of it because i read that book as teenager goes way way waaaaay out of the comfort zone it was very international and very new york uppereast side with just a taste of the memphis setting with what i thought would be a subplot that connected somehow but it never panned out it was still very good very evocative and i did enjoy it it was my fault that i bought it with barely a glance at the synopsis and i will do the same thing next year without a doubt i might dig up another old grisham book from the s that i cant remember and enjoy it to console myself,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,liked the international flavor,4,this new book follows the story of mitch mcdeere from the firm years after he and wife abby escaped from the chicago mob with their lives they now live in nyc with boys with mitch a lawyer in a worldwide law firm that requires lots of travel very little about his earlier life spills into this book until the end the story involves the abduction of one of mitchs colleagues in europe by a middle east group of seeming terrorists mitch flies all over trying to negotiate and gather ransom money abby is also pulled into the fray im not sure a sequel to the firm was needed but this story is interesting and different with its international flavor,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,storyteller extraordinaire john grisham,5,theyre back mitch and abby mcdeere from the firm return in this new tale by grishamthe mcdeeres are no longer naive new college grads facing an uncertain future they are now parents and seasoned world travelers who are now comfortably settled down in excellent jobs life is good they are living the life they had always dreamt for themselves untilmitch is asked for assistance on a case by his good friend what ensues can only be described as a living nightmare perpetrated by truly sick insane people mitch and abbys well ordered comfortable life comes to a screeching halt as do many others who survive the ordealknown for his legal battle books this one took a twist that reads like a political espionagespy thriller it was unexpected parts of the descriptive parts of this book gave me almost overwhelming feelings of nausea all to reminiscent of how i felt when i used to watch the news in the late s s and early struly sick of what mankind does to each other in their respective searches for domination greed prestige and famethat said i read this book from cover to cover in one sitting because it certainly kept some of the when where and how questions unanswered until the very end and because it was a book by john grisham a excellent writer and world class story teller,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,a different read,4,this is not your typical john grisham book theres a lot to read through in some moments of good excitement but virtually all of the book is lawyers maneuvering backandforth to deal with a problem the ending is somewhat satisfactory although theres a part of me that would like to see some sense of justice established however its kind of fun to read about mitch and abby again so if you enjoyed the firm i think youll enjoy this book,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,pretty good,4,good job on this after the firm book i enjoyed the short trip down memory lane from the firm the vivid descriptions of places and the gruesome action but i believe you might have cut this short without revealing who did it and whydoes thus mean the next book will provide all the details and possibly the back story for those violet individuals seeking a million dollar pay day,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,good but not great followup to the firm,4,its hard to call a book set years after the first book a continuation of the mcdeere story its a good read but i have a problem with the whole story being based on saving a hostage by paying terrorists yes every life is important but giving millions to terrorists will cost many more lives and sets a terrible precedent however in that context grisham does weave an exciting tale with many exotic locations and the book is good if you are a grisham fan,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,great follow up grisham book,4,really enjoyed this book the first few chapters i loved great way to connect the firm to the exchangethere are some plot twists i didnt see coming and the story was riveting especially with the war in isreal and gazathe reason for stars instead of i felt the last third or maybe quarter was a little drawn out unnecessarilygrisham doesnt always wrap his books up like youd expect but the ending felt rightgreat read overall,positive
the exchange after the firm the firm series,grisham disappointsbut worth a read,4,i was disappointed that this was not vintage grishamthe exchange was a follow up to the firm from years earlierthis book was not as exciting and was anachronistic regarding current technology in a setting in libya before mghafaffi was toppledhopefully if hollywood picks up the rightsa good screenwriter can spice it up enough to entice mrcruise to lead as mitch mcconnell deere againgood luck,positive

the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,buy this book,5,psychiatrist professor worldclass researcher and traumatologist bessel van der kolk md requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists my enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance cogency frankness and accessibility served up with a subtle dash of impishness he tends to be a bit disruptive something of a provocateur and everything of his i have ever read has taught me something confirmed something important or pushed my thinking in a new direction when he has something to say i want to hear ithowever i almost didnt buy this book i was put off by the title familiar with major reviews of ptsd psychotherapy outcomes research i know that research support for bodyoriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and pe prolonged exposure neither of which are especially bodyfocusedj interlandis excellent article anticipating publication of this book a revolutionary approach to treating ptsd new york times magazine available online initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies interlandi informs us provocateur he may be but im strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects maybe not even if they agree to this as im not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly informed consent knowledge that ptsd and related disorders are usually highly curable when using the right treatment protocols sadly remains the possession of a minority of people even in the professional psychotherapy worldyet the account of van der kolks therapy work in interlandis article is gripping becoming completely absorbed in the account i was convinced ive been here before reading van der kolks own accounts of his work and so the disruption begins deeper into the article he has me van der kolks critique of cbt cognitive behavioral therapy a general class of therapies and pe e foas exposure therapy model is withering and correct neither really work trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognitionit has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous placeits not something you can talk yourself out of interlandi reports that that view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstreambut hes right and i cant stress this enough why because as a trauma treatment professional im well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says the best current summary of this research well may be chapter of ecker et als unlocking the emotional brain buy this book too ecker et al brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses existing therapy models which actually do cure trauma psychopathology if done right in this context what van der kolk is doing makes perfect sense finally it appears the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibilityvan der kolks new book has many virtues parts one and two pp provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of traumas impact on a person its fun interesting informative reading for professional and layperson alike part three pp surveys childhood development attachment experience and the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma van der kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of ptsd which substantially differs from all the rest it develops in response to chronic child abuse andor neglect i completely share his belief that the diagnosis of developmental trauma disorder sometimes called cptsd with c meaning complex is overdue for formal recognition i find his review of the struggle to legitimize dtd as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book it is anguishing to know that a major problem exists and that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it dtdcptsd is no fantasy we see and treat these people as children and adults they exist and they are nothing like ordinary ptsd treatment clientspart four pp focuses on memory ive long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point trauma memory is what causes the problem deal with that and the symptoms vanish why is this so hard to understand yet it is not a common understanding at all explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients and experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone whos lived with it for years if not decades as he does throughout the book van der kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what ive seen happen in my clients making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us people understand things best through narratives offer a good narrative and you convincepsychological trauma therapy is complex but we are now well prepared to launch into the books core content part five pp paths to recovery he gets right to it we cannot undo the trauma but we can undo its effect on us and so get our self back ch reviews existing therapies his approach is to repair descartes error see damsios book of that title by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit his topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute not to be missedhe then writes of the importance of language ch we construct our narrative mainly in words and the words we choose are critical but language is not enough this anticipates his next two chapters our senses encompass a larger world and its center is our body where all our sensory receptors are located then he introduces the treatment model hes long advocated emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing im trained in emdr and in fact van der kolk and i had the same instructor for our advanced training gerald puk phd van der kolk tells an amusing and selfdeprecating story about his advanced training experience in which puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients this is typical van der kolk hes a truthteller even when it may put him in a poor light andafter all at this point he has nothing to prove to anyonefinding an emdr therapist is not hard see his resources section nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body yoga is a wise choice because it is available already widely known and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilitiesthere is much more in part five and the focus is on selfempowerment victim no more as they say most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life that certainly is my own emphasis van der kolks thoughts on selfempowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy clientfor psychotherapy professionals this book will be both delightful and confirming for everyone else it will be a readable gripping highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma that he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated if at all this does not have to be get educated this book will do that then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma they all deserve the chance to be healed and we can now do that van der kolk shows us howthe physical book jacket design is pleasant and interesting binding is less so color of spine wrapping is semiflorescent and of paper not cloth the book feels substantial and pleasant to hold and look atorganization pp prefatory praise by peers and related luminaries interesting comments from some important people in the field pp table of contents pp actual text pp appendix consensus proposed criteria for developmental trauma disorder pp resources pp further reading pp notes pp index,positive
the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,please buy this book and start loving your life,5,of all the nonfiction books ive read this is by far the best one ever i grew up in a tough way lots went wrong my brother and i believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment we suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable when i became an adult i subscribe to the concepts of people like rush limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as posttraumatic stress disorder i believed i could gut it out that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems i believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure frankly for a time that approach worked for me i got married had some great children still have them thankfully built a company but it didnt take too long until it all came crashing down and when it did i spent nearly decades down the anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was to put it mildly a distraction its very hard to be kind to people to focus on your work to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you dont feel like s when you cant sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating at least it feels that way you not only lose the joy of sleep but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when youre not able to understand why you feel this way when you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time much to your embarrassment and yet you think youre smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are life becomes a slog you trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if like me youd never kill yourself literally when i was a believer i went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this dear jesus please have a bus run over me i will never kill myself but im miserable please let me die so my family wont hate me for killing myself but so that i can stop hating the sun coming up in jesus name amen if youre like i was and its hard to tell you how i was and hold the tears down even now this book will help you change all that it will describe in detail what youre going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing for the first time i dont have depression and i dont take pills i dont have anxiety it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness it goes nearly as fast as it comes my life is pointed in the right direction my business future is hopeful my lovelife is stabilizing i know ill no longer lose friends im finally on track to getting what i want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family while i cant attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go mostly you i can absolutely attest to the power of this book if youve suffered any sort of major andor persistent trauma in your life please buy and read this book you will one day thank yourself for doing so,positive
the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,great book,5,this book has been on my reading list for a while and im so glad i finally purchased it helped give me insight into issues i have from time to time and a good friend immediately borrowed it when i finished in talking to my sil i was even able to help her understand some of my brothers behaviors it has been wonderfully helpful in better understanding myself the brain and even how to correct issues i highly recommend,positive
the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,im so glad i read this book,4,wow the body keeps the score has so much information in it im not great at reading technical books especially if they are science related yeah im more of a language arts and social studies kind of gal i have gotten better since i taught sixth grade science but technical brain stuff still confuses me a bit thankfully bessel van der kolk does his best to explain things so that even i can understand them i may have needed to reread some paragraphs a couple of times but i did finally understand itthe body keeps the score is so well written like i said even i was able to understand it the writing style may be more technical but it is still usually easy to understand if youre like me and know very little about the brain youll be good he does a good job of explaining all the different parts of the brain and how trauma affects each of those partsi learned a lot from the examples he shares of his clients and how they have reacted to traumatic experiences its crazy how the same situation can cause such different reactions in one person the experience can cause the persons brain to pretty much shut down while someone elses brain in the same experience can cause more of a fight or flight response i did find it fascinating to learn about these different responsesone of the reasons im glad i read the body keeps the score is so that i will be better prepared and be better able to help my friends family members and students who have suffered from traumatic experiences one of my favorite parts was learning about all the different strategies that can be used to help people heal from their trauma i knew about a few of them but i learned about several unconventional methods that will helpi love that healing focuses on body awareness and mindfulness its all about separating the past and the present and becoming aware of your body it seems strange but apparently when you suffer from a traumatic experience your past and present collide when something triggers your mind in the present you feel the same emotions as you did when you first had the experience at that point it becomes difficult to discern if you are in the present or in the past fascinating rightcontent rating pgprofanity noneintimacy low incest and abuse are noted as causing traumaviolence low he does describe some traumatic experiences his clients have experiencedage recommendation its quite technical and younger readers may not fully understand the content or be able to apply the knowledge there are heavier themes that may not be appropriate for younger readers,positive

the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,do not read the epilogue to this book it completely ruins the book,4,i want to give this book stars but because i think the knowledge in this book is important for the average person to read ill give it stars i want to preface that the epilogue to this book choices to be made is an absolute trashridden garagefilled piece of detritus that doesnt belong anywhere in any sort of literature it almost convinced me that this author is an absolute shill however if one ignores that entire last chapter then the book itself is actually quite superb and the author doesnt seem to be a fraudtrauma is a huge problem in the world many subjects in the modern era have really advanced in order to better understand the human brain mind and the processes connecting them mainly due to technological advancements such as the fmri i would think that to most people trauma is something that can detrimentally and sometimes irreversibly harm someone if that someone is a child this damage is multiplied by a billion however what i think that people end up lacking is the knowledge of whenhow trauma can form it isnt just caused by obvious phenomena such as war natural disasters tragic family accidents it can be caused by simple things as well such as verbal arguments falling off a bike as a child or a parent working long hours and never seeing his or her child this is why this book is important it makes it known that trauma is a lot or can be a lot more ubiquitous than people thinkthe book is broken down into a few sections i would say about of this book is background on a variety of subject matter this certainly could have been shortened down by about but i suppose more information is generally better in this case i would likely disagree as the book itself is already too long so removing the fluff would likely have been a good idea the last of the book is about solutions to trauma i wont go into each chapter and mention every main point but overall each chapter is worth at the very least a heavy skimthe background knowledge on trauma is really interesting we learn what parts of the brain are activated during trauma and parts that are activated posttrauma this help us to understand why people may freeze during a traumatic experience why people cant express their feelings when they become triggered and why certain medications work better than others the information here really opened my eyes as to why people who have experienced trauma can act so strangely and illogically just tell me what emotion you are feeling stop trying to hit me what the hell do you think youre doing i feel like i can sympathize more with these people and have a better understanding of how to approach themthe solutions to this were quite impressive and honestly seemed fairly simple in nature examples include emdr which is essentially just a mixture of hypnosis and rem sleep initiation braincomputer interface technology to control frequencies produced by your brain talking yoga theater etc there is no cureall method but rather each solution needs to be tailored to each individual obviously drugs are an option here but this merely is a temporary solution and doesnt fix trauma at alli want to finish this with my negative opinions on this book and the author overall the author seems to be fairly knowledgeable and truly caring however this book is full of their bias and it really shows a few examples are as follows the author does a good job at adding references in this book when making claims but when you pay attention to the location of the references it is clear that the author is tacitly picking and choosing what they need to reference for one the author really hates drugs and by that i mean medications used to treat people with mental disorders or trauma he makes that very clear throughout this entire book so he will reference some statistics that say drug use is bad when he makes a claim but then a few sentences later he makes another claim that negatively talks about drugs but doesnt cite any reference he tries to make you think that the reference sentences ago would also be for this but in reality it doesnt i see this as pseudoscience he thinks he is being clever but in reality he is just being a biased con artist and not even close to a real scientist as i mentioned early the epilogue to this book is just atrocious this is where he gets into politics and tries to tie trauma to all sort of institutions and societal structures he blames trauma on guns healthcare teachers etc he think that teachers are to blame they dont comfort kids enough and writes off the parents bad behavior at home as something that happens but the teacher needs to be the parent then he paints the usa at times as some crazy country where schools and healthcare is years behind what it should be but doesnt talk about these same exact issues sometimes even worse in western europe where these political structures are different but the problem still remains im very happy this was an epilogue and not an introduction because if it was i would have thrown this book into my compost bin immediately if it was,positive
the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,excellent read,5,fascinating read the book gives an insight to the stories of peoples struggles research and solutions,positive
the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma,i made so many connections,4,this book was so very well researched and detailed the content connected exquisitely with a medication class where we have been learning about body systems and the implications for meditating as a veteran teacher and administrator in elementary education i connected with how all of a childs experiences form the person they are talk therapy applications can help likely more so than medications the book reminded me of joseph chilton pierces the magical child and other books regarding childhood development and recovery especially those books written by occupational therapy practitioners,positive
a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,bow down to the queen of ya fantasy,5,this book with its magic fairytale roots and steamy hot romance deserves all of the stars i loved ithere are the five reasons why i gave a court of thorns and roses out of stars and then some fairytale retellingi was a little wary of this story when i discovered that it was a fairytale retelling i love the story of beauty and the beast growing up i watched the disney version all of the time but not as much as i watched pocahontas however in the past i have struggled to find enjoyment in beauty and the beast retellings particularly beastly by alex flinn i did not enjoy the book or the moviei think i was worried that a court of thorns and roses wouldnt feel original but it was the complete opposite maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love but is also independent and utter creative genius maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills yes there is a curse and magic and a love story but there is also dark magic and steamy romance and i do mean steamy and blood and gore and court drama basically all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat rosecolored bowthere were some twists on the original story of beauty and the beast that i really enjoyed for example in the original story the residentsservants of the beasts home are cursed and transformed into household items however in acotar rather than being transformed into household items maas cursed characters must wear masquerade masks and have done so for years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party i also appreciated that though tamlin was a beast that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him rather as a fae he has the power of shapeshifting and takes the form of a beast usually when fighting so throughout most of the book tamlin is portrayed as a glorious chiseled man of steel some readers believe that the fact that tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the beauty and the beast story line however no one writes hot male love interests like sarah j maas so i am not complaining about tamlin at alloverall i found that i loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything i enjoyed drawing comparisons between maas story and characters and the story i grew up with maas world is so intriguing engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go genrewhile we know that acotar is a fairytale retelling that is not to say that it is a childrens book i went into this book thinking that it was young adult however there is a particular scene that takes place after the great rite on fire night such a good scene by the way just wait for it that made me take a step back and think whoa this is way too sexy and erotic for young adult literaturelooking back at goodreads i found that the book was listed as young adult and new adult but i would personally classify this book as new adult having read many new adult novels i found that the sex rating for acotar resonates with that of a new adult novel i think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know sarah j maas as a young adult author i personally have no problem with this genre however for parents who are giving this book to their young children or for those readers who dont enjoy sex scenes in their books you have been warnedi love the new adult genre and discovering that acotar fell into that genre made me love it even more i appreciate the more mature content and that the characters are closer to my age feyre is and hey i appreciate the sexy times too there is no shame in my game because who am i kidding i have no game i had also never read a new adult fantasy before so i was glad to be exploring new territoryim absolutely impressed with maas as a writer she is not afraid to be different to venture out to new places i love that she is entering this new genre and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future feyre the protagonistwhen i started reading acotar i was sure maas was going to give us another celaena sardothien a badass girl who is nearly invincible yet lovable and cool however feye pronounced fayruh is so different from other fantasy protagonists i have read because she is so unapologetically human she is normal and she is flawed and i found that i could easily relate to her character feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to she is no fighter not outstandingly gorgeous and she is also illiterate a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not endin the beginning feyre is not very likable she is cold harsh stubborn and hardheaded but readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way once at the spring court where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and lifes simple pleasures feyre easily becomes a character you cant help but root for and love tamlin an impending love trianglesince we have discussed feyre i believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest tamlintamlin is a bae fae warrior with magical abilities he is also gorgeous kindhearted and strong and he places feyres happiness and wellbeing above all else but he is not perfect he is flawed haunted by his familys past by his own mistakes and the lives he has taken but through all of that he still strives to do and be goodhowever i admit that while i love tamlin i am worried that maas has a love triangle in the works for book of acotarbecause rhysandrhys a sexy dangerous fae is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws or rather talons into feyre and i cant say that i hate him i actually like his character although we witness him do some terrible things even to feyre he seems edgy fun and is incredibly witty maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters even the morally ambiguous ones while tamlin is all gorgeous and good rhys has that hotbuttragic thing going for himi am already struggling with the love square maas has going on in the throne of glass series between celaena and her three love interests chaol dorian and rowan i dont think that i will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles but i think that as long as no one else is introduced as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage everything will be fine supporting characterswhile maas main characters are at the center of attention her supporting characters keep this book afloat with less focus and fewer appearances maas supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the showfirst there is lucien the redhaired oneeyed fae who is tamlins best friend he is initially rude to feyre but eventually warms up to her they easily develop a sort of bigbrotherlittlesister relationship i would consider lucien to be the storys comic relief he is humorous and sarcastic and i adore his characterthere is also amarantha the storys evil villainess she is a fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans which is not good for feyre she is cold calculating and cruel but she has a backstory all the best villains have backstories and i dont want to spoil you all so i will just say that when you learn her backstory you realize why amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving although while i can sympathize with her on some level i find her evil ways to be too much at times however i still find her to be an interesting wellwritten characterand of course there is rhysand whom i mentioned earlier he is incredibly important to the story of book and will have an even larger presence in book i cannot wait to learn more about his character because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and i just know that i am going to love himhonorable mentionsmaas writingi believe that acotar is maas at her best as i stated earlier we are definitely seeing maas hone and perfect her skill each book she releases is always better than the last what i liked most about maas writing in acotar was her use of first person throne of glass is written in third person and with changing character perspectives i find that i can tend to get bored with certain characters but with acotar told from feyres perspective i felt engaged throughout the entire bookfaerie worldi literally want to live in prythian in the world of the fae that exists beyond the wall just without all of the drama maas depicts the spring court so beautifully and vividly it seems like a literal heaven on earthother than the beauty of the fae world there are the parties and festivities i mentioned fire night and the great rite earlier two very interesting festivities held in the fae world and then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons such as summer solstice and midsummer it is all so fantastical and fun readers are just dying to step into the pagesthere is not much else i can say about a court of thorns and roses i loved this book i have no idea how i am going to wait an entire year for the sequel its going to be excruciating but i am sure that it is going to worth it because sarah j maas is a fabulous queen of writing and every word she writes turns to gold,positive
a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,not a perfect book but a good book,5,i bought the trilogy all together they were the best books ive read in a while separately they were not perfect but im okay with that i read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth or have wishywashy villains or have instalove or have love result from h saving h from sexual violation or suffer from deus ex machina i dont particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes i want to read something that is easy and obvious my brain doesnt want to be challenged also i love good dialogue dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than instalovey is dialogue actionpacked no does it slow down pacing you bet at this point youre probably wondering where this review is going well i think that knowing more about me as a reader might make it easier to see relate to my views for this booknow the fun stuff spoilersfeyre the hthis character is complex and goes through several changes throughout the series in this book she has her ups and downs initially she is hardened streetsmart and capable with a cynical eye toward romance and happiness and outright hatred and prejudice towards the fae she also has love for a family who seems to dislike and neglect her she is not very likeable but does that make a book bad no hello wuthering heights it is however more rare to write an h this way because readers in general tend to want to relate to an h particularly when its written in st person perspective so many readers might not be able to get into the story because of their dislike for feyre when the far remove her burdens that largely drove who she was feyre changes she doesnt have a purpose to keep her going to shape her the pacing of the book suffers a bit here while she tries to sort herself out she tries to make love and painting her new purposes and while she has the determination to do so the fit just isnt right does this make the book bad no while many people wont like to read about an h that seems somehow less this downward arc was necessary to fuel the inevitable reversal toward a more fitting purpose it drags a bit for sure but makes the reversal feel more right more true later on did she rush into something with tamlin her feelings do feel a bit rushed but ultimately fit her as a character going allin has always been her style from the start in that sense the character is consistent also her reluctance to voice her love made me think that deepdown she might have confused love with gratitude tamlin was her savior in many ways for all of these reasons i liked feyretamlin the htamlin was the st high fae feyre had any meaningful interactions with in the st book i never really liked him as an h he was pretty but basically hollow he struggles with uncontrolled rage he had just as much hatred for humans as feyre did for fae and his elitist attitude was hinted at throughout this book though not substantiated until book he also adheres to fae tradition in weird ways his willing participation in the fire night ritual is distasteful because it borders on infidelity especially since we later learn in book that he can designate a replacement tamlin has from the beginning been primarily focused on tamlin when things get tough he sends feyre away he doesnt consult or listen to her but just decides hinting at his desire to treat her like a possession rather than a person when he gets a moment of freedom under the mountain he attempts to have sex with feyre his wants instead of trying to escape with or save her her needs when feyre is dying he can only bring himself to beg for her life he isnt moved into action all of these things hint that tamlin is not a good fit for feyre many readers will not like to read about an h that is so lacking illfitted the beautiful part is that these things are only ever hinted at in the writing not outright stated so you will want to root for tamlin while also feeling something inexplicably lacking in him i thought about it lots before i picked up book where my thoughts regarding tamlin were cemented tamlin could not have been written more likeable though if he was the perfect h then feyre falling for rhys in book would have felt like a betrayal instead of fated and then feyre wouldve been worse than unlikable but detestable as an hluciana secondary character who is both interesting and flawed he hates feyre at first but ultimately warms up to her he is loyal to a fault siding with tamlin over and again even when he thinks it is wrong to do so a trait that becomes more obvious as the series progresses lucian has potentialrhysand villainother hrhysand was the most interesting character in the book although nesta was a close second rhys was the evil queens righthand man he has done terrible things yet when we meet him not my favorite bit of the book because of the gross circumstances i do not favor as mentioned above there is evidence that he is not all that he seems he appeared to be interested in feyre romantically but the why part is not there also it is not certain what drives his actions he is a mystery why did he decide to help her time and again why if he likes her did he decide to put her through nightly humiliation why use her to torment tamlin he is clearly not a good guy he is complexother things people often talk aboutthe sex there is a lot more sex in this book than in other ya books it seems like that has somehow lead to some amount of controversy i find that notion very strange as many eons ago when i was a teen sex was a big part of being a teen whether or not to have it who had it when they had it where and how what type of birth control to use etc suggestions that a book would have any type of influence on those things are just silly teens have sex its a fact wishing it otherwise does nothing productive also the sex in this series is not explicit every time i see this adjective used it makes me laugh i have read many romances and even some erotica if you truly want something explicit check out erotica phrases like the apex of my thighs or the the length of him are not explicitthe copious dialogue lots of readers dont like the extended dialogue and also wish to have seen more of the fae world i am just guessing here but i am thinking that they are meaning that they wanted less talk and more fairy magic but fae are known for more than just their magic another key attribute of fae has to do with their words being able to only speak in rhyme only speak the truth answer any question posed etc this attribute can be very interesting see mortal instruments series or dresden files and indeed it was put to use throughout the series sometimes well done other times much too dues ex machina for my liking dialogue can be a type of action when done well enough in this book it probably couldve been better but was good enough for methe fire night and rape culture honestly i am bothered by this one i am never fond of rape or sexual violence as a plot device which is why i tend to avoid historical romances almost entirely in this book i think the fire nite ritual was used in part explain a bit about fae magic and in part to push forward the feyretamlin relationship while introducing rhys i think it both went too far and not far enough tamlins participation cheapens his feelings toward feyre just imagine someone saying i love you truly but i need to go have sex with someone else and then he came back to feyre after having sex with someone else and bit her to clearly show his possession of her it doesnt sit well does it additionally the three fae with bad intentions suggest to feyre that fae tradition gives them the right to violate her just because she is present that makes all fae seem brutal and detestable thus it goes too far but what about the converse the fire night ritual is supposed to be necessary to ensure the bounty of the land for the next year but the spring court is the only court that has observes this ritual en mass that does not really make sense to me the need for this ritual especially considering mated bonds are a rare and extremely valued thing is not properly explained it really couldve been omitted from the book and is one of the few things about the book that i truly did not likethe masks some people like them some dont the reason given for them was that they were yet another obstacle to a human girl falling in love with tamlin i really didnt mind them but i did not like feyres reaction to the removal of the masks while it was consistent with her character she always had an eye for pretty guys i thought that it cheapened her character to have her feel relieved that tamlin was so pretty without his mask it was very superficial and further proof that there wasnt much of substance to their lovewhile book is my least favorite of the series i still really liked it and will definitely reread it again books and get even better and i am looking forward to further writings as well hopefully we will get to see what happens to nesta elaine the th queen and bryaxis,positive

a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,beautiful cover,4,having heard much raving about this series i was poking around on amazon when i saw this collectors edition it is indeed gorgeous although i do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark the gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain paper black covers that are on most hardbacks today and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf it wasnt the first time i had bought a book for the coveraside from hearing reviews from fans i also saw a reference to the book when reading about patricia a mckillips winter rose which i had recently read and its connection to the ballad of tam lin this same fairy tale apparently had influence on holly blacks tithe also although the high lord in maass tale is named tamlin the story is obviously a retelling of beauty and the beast the story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale east of the sun west of the moon wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich whereas neither beauty and the beast nor east of the sun west of the moon have fairy characters aside from a witch or enchantress here and there in the story tam lin he is identified as an elf in maass retelling which court is cursed to wear masks tamlins friends mask is clearly stated as a fox whereas tamlins mask is only vaguely described and he is often referred to as a beast the lack of description was a tad infuriatingwhile set in a fairy tale period of time past the main character clearly has modern ideas she has no mother and a weak father figure and furthermore was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters despite the fact that she is the youngest the family has only recently fallen into poverty and the main characters upbringing has been neglected she learns to hunt to feed the family and unlike the bookloving belle of the disney fairy tale no one bothers to teach her how to read although she is presented with a library at which point if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated you now know for sure according to the internet the characters name feyre means fair beautiful like the name belle dyswsdt i myself am not a fan of retellings and even less of modern retellings although i do appreciate influences and notes here and thereas a novel the story has a single plot line i have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion but a novel requires a bit more substance although it was interesting enough for me to finish i am not sure that i feel compelled to read the rest of the series particularly if there is no matching collectors edition for me the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end and i had already guessed the answer to the riddle i found feyres modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire and i found her difficult to like which is basically how i feel about most strong female characters i do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong stubborn i can get stubborn and dumb at the same time noacotar has a lexile score of which puts it at the lower end of a th grade reading level you wont learn any new big words and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the heros journey template little to no deviation ie no big surprises it is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters the descriptions of the fairy land not merely a realm were not as detailed as those in julie kagawas the iron fey series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals the writing was a bit awkward at several points where one characters actions were in the same paragraph with another characters dialogue so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas so was it bad obviously not that bad since i finished it will i read more of her stories i cant say for sure but probably not unless they issue an attractive collectors edition worthy of the bookshelf it satisfied my curiosity but for feyrelated books i recommend jim butchers dresden series and julie kagawas iron fey series both have mindblowing descriptions and intricacies im always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if its possible so i gave it three stars for being okay plus one for a really nice cover,positive
a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,glad i finally started acotar,5,id had this series on my tbr for ages a court of thorns and roses burst onto the scene a good eight years ago and hasnt let up on instagram and tiktok like that friend whos always the center of attention let me be clear fantasy isnt usually my cup of tea but the incessant chatter about these books made me feel like i was missing out so i finally embarked on acotar and it was a slow start to say the least id read a bit then it would gather dust for days weeks and sometimes months worldbuilding felt a bit like trying to join a conversation in a foreign language bewilderingaround the twothirds mark though the book finally caught my interest the story took a turn for the better but then it seemed like the book was about to conclude and yet it carried onand on all said the writing in this book is truly impressive the characters are finely detailed and genuinely engaging at its core the story is a sort of beauty and the beast reinterpretation but lets be clear this is no standard fairy tale after beauty falls for the beast theres a lot more in store the beast has hidden depths and belle isnt your typical disney princess i now get why folks adore this series im currently immersed in the second book and its progressing at a brisk pace everythings set up and im beginning to feel like ive joined the ranks with excitement and a cup of coffee in hand im eagerly anticipating the adventures that await in the rest of the series bring on the sequels,positive

a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,acotar is nothing more than erotica,2,so here i sit having gone through the omg acotar series is amazing phase and out the other end i can sit back and think what the actual hellim a huge maas fan so when i found out she was writing another series i had to have it for the first time in a long time my library actually got the book within a month of its release so i checked out acotar and read it in a single day i loved itbooks two came out and while i was super disappointed in the pointless sex thrown in every so often and whole chapters dedicated to this nonsense i continued reading because the story was compelling enough and then acowar emerged and everything changedthis was a series i read numerous times before acowar came out and i saw things that genuinely bothered me but i ignored them i dont even know why until i just couldnt stand it anymoreacotar is nothing more than erotica i feel like the series as a whole started out with plans of being some sort of story porn that has a kickass plot with hot scenes thrown in for whatever reason and then it got to acowar and decided it wanted to be the bachelor or a soap opera insteadthe relationship between tamlin and feyre greatly disturbs me shes taking care of her family and he swoops in after she accidentally kills a fae who was disguised as a wolf int he woods where hunters hunt and takes her away claiming shes going to be in trouble and damned and blah blah no shes pampered and given servants and pretty clothes and good food tamlin dresses her up like a doll and makes snide remarks when she falls short of his goals fae goals mind youfeyre is a human tamlin is fae he acts like her humanity is a curse or something to hold against her and he constantly makes remarks about how shes too fragile too uneducated too plain etc instead of fixing these issues tamlin does nothing other than tell her what to do and not dohe sexually assaults her after calanmai and in the book feyre shows how much she does not want his advances and he shoves her against the wall and bites her then tells her not to ever go against him again how is this ok if my husband ever did this to me id kick him in the crotch and leave this is not ok this is not a relationship this is abuse which is why it disgusts me that people go on and on about tamlinthe fact that feyre and tamlin have sex at a later time after he did this makes it worse why feyre are you going to throw yourself at a man who a doesnt care about you based off his degrading comments and b threatens you not only that he basically blames her for a nearrape experience when he literally did nothing to look out for her andor stop the guys who were going to attack herthat being said i have a lot of issues with feyre she gets off too easy on everything and its like her brain is only wired to care if the dude is hot you take care of your family but then you walk into tamlins embrace after the things he has said and done i understand she has been abused by this but at the same time she could have said no death is a lot better than basically being a sex slave or punching bag to an immortal person determined to imprison you until you dieshes never punished for killing a fae lucien and tamlin tell her about magical creatures that could give her what she wants and the next day she walks out and finds themthe elusive creaturesthat are hard for fae to findlucien is about the only well developed character and hes too sexualized sometimes for me to take me seriously if you keep pointing out the abs tanned skin or whatever on the dude youre turning them into a slab of meat all of the males and truthfully the females as well in acotar are perfect in the idea of what todays society thinks is beauty sexy and amazing at everything this is sexist on every account your characters become nothing more than fantasieswhich is why i say this is nothing more than porneroticasure you can get some great messages out of this series but is it worth all of the dung in the way specifically with the later books theres too much sex at some points for it to even be ok please go try to have sex that many times or for days on end and tell me how that is if you can do that im sorry but youre either a whore or youre just kinda crazy because thats too muchwhy i ever read this book and like it i truthfully dont know but im done with this series im done with this fandom and im fed up with seeing people swoon or make comments or even drawlike at that nude art about literary characters guys seriously this is not a book for young girls but when i went to the first and last maas event most of the audience there were between the ages of predominately years of age and screamed when maas was mentioning sex scenes im not going to continue to support a series that is encouraging young teens and young women to have unrealistic ideas of men as well as sexual fantasies especially the married women who ive seen act this same way if i were your husband i wouldnt be able to deal with that i wouldnt want those books in my houseabout the only good thing i have to say for acotar was that there actually was a plot in this book and it was good if insanely slow to get rolling and the amount of sex was fairly minimal,negative
a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,beauty and the beast meets faerie,3,beauty and the beast meets faerie i should adore this but overall it was just okay there are things i totally loved about this story but they are marred by the things that didnt quite work out for me and so what im left with is feeling in the middle where i didnt love it but i didnt hate it eitherim a huge fan of beauty and the beast retellings or most fairytales actually but belle is my absolute favorite heroine because she is smart reads and doesnt fall head over heels for the first pretty face that happens along she and i could totally be bffs then there is the fae now im not a big expert on faerie stories or anything like that but i find the fae to be totally interesting creatures and usually like it when they are incorporated into stories instead if this being a magical mashup that made the story soar to new heights of awesome i found myself seeing some serious sour notes that disjointed the story and made it feel clunkythe stuff i totally loved tamlin and his faerie world there are some really interesting descriptions of the time spent at the his manor the lake full of starlight the manor the art and his court cursed to all be in masks tamlin is completely likable right from the near beginninglucien he is a spunky guy full of vim and vinegar that fayre has a lot of fun verbally sparring with and getting into general trouble he is also a great friend to tamlin and i love the brotherly bound between them while lucien has an easy way with people he is working hard to help his friend find the right way to woo fayre the love story i enjoyed the time tamlin and feyre were getting to know each other and the tentative flirting the best i really wish there was maybe just a little more time spent on it as it was the basis for the last of the bookmy father once told me that i should let my sisters imagine a better lifea better world and i told him that there was no such thing i ran my thumb over his mouth marveling and shook my head i never understoodbecause i couldnt couldnt believe that it was even possible i swallowed lowering my hand until now the tasks i like the idea behind completing some challenges to prove your worth and love i liked even more that it was feyre the girl who had to do this instead of prince charming it was a nice twist to a normal fairytale the curse while not particularly a fan of the fact the curse made tamlin and his court all have to wear masks since i really thought it would have been better if they all had to remain in animal form i did like the final symmetry and cruelty of the curse it was different and i totally respect that it was a truly fae curse in the level of cruelty behind it rhysand was my favorite character and ill totally admit im still not sure what exactly i think of him i will say this though he is the most interesting character in the book whether he is playing on the side of good or evilwell you will have to make your own decision on that but i seriously hoping the next book is about himas this is the start of a new series i will give it some leeway at getting started there are some really fun parts to the story and even though it is a bit clunky at times i still got to a point when they are under the mountain that i needed to get through the story to see how it all worked out and this is where the story mostly stayed on the like side of the linethe stuff that missed the mark when writing about a wellestablished lore i think there are some things that perhaps the reader will accept or not accept based on how important or ingrained it is or the story the author puts with the lore change based on my various readings there are a few things about fantasy creatures that are ingrained into me i know that vampires drink blood cant be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heart werewolves silver bullets shifting of some kind full moon fae immortal tricksters cant lie zombie human dead eat fleshim not going to say the maas changed the fae lore so much that she stephanie meyerd it but she pretty much made a change to the fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight it isnt quite a deal breaker for me but im not a fan of that particular lore twist either it pains me to say this but feyre and i didnt get along until about of the way through the book she does so many stupid things that honestly i went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with hershe began strong and independent with a family to support and i really liked that she wasnt your typical virgin heroine she hunted for her family and was the main supporter not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strongafter ending up in tamlins court and promising to stay the first thing feyre tries to do is escape when tamlin assures her that he has seen to her familys comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again she puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresomewerent you warned to keep your wits about you tamlin snapped that your human senses would betray youhe stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark fool he said to me turning if youre ever going to run away at least do it in the daytimei liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likablethe curse yes i know that it is up in the like part as well you get points because you noticed the story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly i thought it made tamlin hotter instead of diminished masks are sexy i dont care who you are just think about it zorro phantom of the opera a slew of superheroes andthe dread pirate robertstamlin had a beast form so i thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality just an opinionthe rite there is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival im not a prude i swear but it really bothered me how that played out the whole scene made me feel a little strange and i really wasnt sure what to do with my feelings about it maybe if i knew some other fae stories and knew that was what the rite of spring was i wouldnt have minded but i was not prepared on a good note i was happy that it didnt have any negative residual affects between feyre and tamlinoverall thoughtssometimes at the beginning of a new series you cant see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you i will say that when i read throne of glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then i loved both crown of midnight and heir of fire im hoping that is also the case with this seriesbased on how the book ended i have some really high hopes for the next book of this series if you like fairytale retellings or faerie stories then i say still give this one a go if anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is maas so im not concerned and think she could be off to a solid startbegs sarah j maas to have the next book be about rhysand and dare i hope for itnesta,neutral
a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,detailed to an excessive degree but plot is good,4,ive read books in this series and despite the plot being great especially between the two main lovebirds in book i dont plan to keep reading the chronic excessive explanation with surroundings in the environment and feelings almost worded as if taken from poetry books to a point of where it doesnt even make sense sometimes just keeps taking away from enjoying the plot already i just want to get to the point of what matters between characters and though its normal to have it drawn out in most fictional relationships to keep the suspense this series just did it too much for my liking took way to long for the story to finally bring to light what the heck is going on between az and mor only for it to not even be that out there of a reason theyve existed for hundreds of years and still havent found a way to talk about her real reasons for not wanting him poor az thats just damn cruel and cowardly of mor this is a great series but its definitely for the younger mind when the interesting scenes between the main lovebirds starting getting less and lessinterest to read last two books gone there were a lot of gray areas between the different characters relationships in a way my mind got tired of trying to figure out how they really perceive one another stars because the plot is still good not because the depth of connection between characters felt constantly side tracked instead of being put first,positive
a court of thorns and roses a court of thorns and roses,doesnt deserve the hate,5,okay so i might lost some of my favorite critics over this because i know a lot of you werent a fan of this book and i have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao i will talk about some flaws with the book still as no book is perfect but for the most part i really loved it there will be rants i have alot to say sooo here we go before i lose my nerve lmaomy main petty annoyance the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when hes in beast form lol there i said it now lets move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever i feel like im supposed to hate maas and her writing but i dont i really love what she did herecharactersfeyrei really dont get the hate maybe she gets worse later maybe but people hate her in this book too and i dont get why she was meh to me i admired her in some ways and hated her in others i loved her heart and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her which yes did annoy me sometimes but it wasnt that badnow we get to the fun parttamlin and rhyes similar thoughts on bothoh my god the reasons you guys hate this dude are absurd in this book every single thing i was told to look out for and that would start me into hating him was ridiculous i genuinely believe you guys just dont ship him and feyre so that makes him immediately sooo horrible same for the rhyes hatersyou guys have to stop inserting in a fantasy setting and acting like any of the decisions made are simple both of them are great in their own way and both had feyres interest in mind in my opinion the questionable things they do because yes there are someare either for show to save feyre and everyone else its all so obviously calculated and here you guys are trying to critique it like theyre events that happened over tea in a totally normal world with nothing intense or life threatening going on around them just whyim team rhys just because i like him a little more and i love the way he thinks and speaks but i also love tamlin and am still rooting for him to be happyi think theyre both fleshed out brilliantly and have many layers that i cant wait to uncover they both have scars and they both have really unfortunate situations that are eating away at them that make them who they are im just saying think about the alternative that could happen if they didnt make some of their questionable choicesthey wouldnt have done half the stuff they did for this one human if they didnt truly carevillainwell shes like not very nice lol so of course i dont like her and im not rooting for her butidk i put her here because i did kind of have a problem with how stupid she seemed to be for someone who was supposed to be cunning she let certain people get away with way too much and didnt seem to notice or care it was strange because then she would just randomly turn into a brutal witch out of nowhere but then let certain things happen other times im sure some of it was her calculating but still it seemed a little weakshes bitter brutal and interesting the ring will probably haunt my nightmares she just wasnt as developedlucieni dont want him with feyre but i just wanted to say despite me liking tam and rhyes lucien will forever be my babe i love him the most hes so complex and hes been through so muchhes witty intelligent and overall just cares about people even when he pretends he doesnt i want nothing but greatness for him lol his story is heart breaking as wellthe rest this story is filled with intriguing misunderstood and terrifying creatures no complaints thereher family feyres family is on my poop list but i dont hate nesta even now as some of you seem to maybe im a mean bitter person idkthe plotlike every plot it has both weak and strong points i loved seeing the world unfold and getting to see a good chunk of it before the action startedi did think the twist with the masks and how convenient all of the events were was well convenientwhile it did lead to the most exciting parts i felt like the point of it was kinda glossed over and the explanation for why things were how they are wasnt too important to the storybut it came over decently and the ending wasnt terrible so im happyi still got the magical yet unsettling experience i wanted and i cant wait to see more of this worldi really feel like its just the cool thing to hate maas and these books now but i dont see them as problematic as a lot of people seem to i had an incredibly enjoyable time reading them and i saw the reasons behind the words think what you want about me because of that lol i will not defend myself for not seeing the issues other people see i will be continuing,positive
a little life,a tragic and memorable tale,4,you know when someone talks to you about a sad book and you immediately think well someone precious is going to die at the end a little life has been called tragic depressing a masterpiece that you cannot get through without a wad of tissues nearby and so naturally i assumed someone would die at the end i went into this book prepared to not get too attached to the characters but its inevitable to not connect with people who are the subjects of an page book with minimal spacing and tiny font id like to think i went into this book prepared but my preparation got me nowherethis novel does not lead up to a sad ending let me explain calling this novel sad is a massive understatement it is pages of tragedy after tragedy because the sad doesnt follow the pattern we are used to its not happy and pleasant until the end where something sad happens no this book is a depressing hunk of paper with very little happiness in it a little life is a long winding tunnel spotted with skylights you walk forward in the darkness with a couple of friends and you are struck with sadness after sadness your friends get lost in the tunnel you fall and break your arm and then the tunnel gives you a foot of light where you can look around and take a breather before plunging yourself into the darkness you dont know whats at the end because the tunnel gives you no hints you dont know if youll exit into the open you dont know if youll hit a deadend but you keep on walking because by this point your masochism has kicked in and youre addicted to the torturewe follow the stories of four characters all collegefriends who have moved from boston to new york city in order to fulfill their dreams malcolm is an aspiring architect timid and shy whose overbearing parents are his pride and shame jb is a painter arrogant optimistic and full of life jb is the only one among his friends who is certain he will make it in life willem is an actor calm and steady who has no family but his three best friends but while the three have their own lives their bond is strengthened by the presence of one jude st francis jude is enigmatic despite having been friends for years nobody knows anything about him not his ethnicity or his sexuality they dont know anything about his childhood or his years before attending university jude has an injury an accident severely limited the use of his legs but nobody even knows how this came to be but jude is quiet and he is kind and generous and dependent and so the three friends lend their shoulders silently for him to lean on this book is not set in one time period years and decades pass and each character matures develops and experiences success and the perils of life sometimes together other times apart as the narrative progresses one thing becomes crystal clear jude has gone through an unspeakable childhood trauma he is fragile and broken battling so hard with inner demons that never seem to leave himif youre looking for a fastpaced actionpacked plotcentered novel put this book down and walk far far away a little life reads more like an indepth character study than anything else despite there being a large diverse wellfleshed out cast of characters make no mistake this novel is about jude this novel is about judes life his depression his experiences his feelings of pain and insurmountable shame it is a story about judes relationships and his impact on the people around him it is a story about love and loss of betrayal and friendship of perseverance and giving in and because it follows the story of such a broken intense young man it is a difficult readit is a difficult read in more ways than one firstly it is pages long with very little action with large chunks of paragraphs detailing the little moments in life detailing theorems and laws and art and literature large chunks that talk about family sex career and the meaning of love things that may not even need to be in the book these large chunks familiarize you with our characters backgrounds their introspections and streams of consciousness their experiences with each other and outside of their immediate relationships the characters in this novel feel real more than once i felt like i could reach out and touch them they feel like friends comrades youve known for a long long time their happiness genuinely excites you and their sadness genuinely devastates you you also become so invested in their relationships with each other almost as if youre a mediatorapart from the thematic material what makes this novel so hard to digest is the characters im not exaggerating when i say that they feel like friends watching them suffer through unimaginable things hurt me i have never felt this way before halfway through the book i had already cried at least twice excluding the point where i sobbed for ten pages straight and then again after yanagiharas empathetic portrayal of human nature of human decency and monstrosity is so spoton i dont know what else i can saysecondly it is brutal in its honest unflinching portrayal of mental illness there were several moments in this novel where i had to set the book aside and steady my breathing it is uncomfortable it depicts selfharm and depression graphically but not gratuitously with sensitivity without doing it for the shock factor finally the constant jumps in time frame makes this book far from a casual read you need to keep up each section takes place a few years after the previous one but sometimes yanagihara alternates time within paragraphs as well one time youre seeing the friends lives when they are and you jump back in the middle of a paragraph to when they are it can be quite jarring if youre not paying attentionbut having said that yanagiharas writing is easy to keep up with daunting as it may be with its intelligent discussion of many themes some of which i mentioned above and the sheer scale of the book her writing is welcoming complex full of emotion and genuine feeling full of quotable things without it ever being overbearing or too much authors writing in the literary fiction genre so often give off the impression that they need to prove something but yanagihara writes with effortless grace and poise shes not trying to prove anything this is her in pages take it or leave itbut despite all my praises this is not a perfect book my main complaint is the length bear with me i have no problems with lengthy books as long as the length is justified many will probably disagree with me but i felt that the novel could have been cut short by at least or pages for example towards the beginning we get such an indepth look into jb and malcolms characters much of which doesnt come back after the first section perhaps their backgrounds could have been weaved more seamlessly into the narrative as the book went along a lot of the objective discussions about science and mathematics were beautifully written sure but didnt feel like they needed to be there but ive got to give yanagihara this despite the length and despite the discussions on objective topics i was hanging on to her every word i didnt skim a single page i was just that investedso here we are you and me at the mouth of the tunnel i made it out and youre asking me if you should take the chance its difficult its long its even terrifying at times but and i prod you into the darkness its also exhilarating and beautiful and one hell of an experience,positive
a little life,lost to the world,5,ill be blunt upfront a little life by hanya yanagihara is the most soulwrenching novel i have perhaps ever read in the novel yanagihara follows in minute detail the lives of four men who become friends a clique in college and continue to be close into their late fifties jb marion begins his work life as a receptionist at a small but influential magazine based in soho that covered the downtown art scene with ambitions to become an artist fatherless since he was three jb is of haitian descent tends toward being overweight and is gay willem ragnarsson handsome and liked by everyone starts out as a waiter but has his eye set on becoming a professional actor on stage and screen in ways malcolm irvine is the outlier of the group still living at home with his parents who are a couple of mixedrace he is wealthy and determined to become an architect malcolm appears to be oblivious of his appeal to others even nave somewhat confused about his sexuality and unmindful of his financial situation although generous to his friends and others when they are in need at the core of the four friends is jude st francis who holds the group togethernot so much by what he does even though he is considerably bright loyal and hardworking as well as determined to become a prosecutor but because his friends care about him and jude has needs parentless and with a mysterious past all of which he never speaks about and never having a girlfriend or a boyfriend jude has trouble with his legs and is frequently in pain although he never complains nor asks for help his friends are very aware of his situation and go out of their way to assist jude in as tactful of a manner as possiblemainly set in new york city as a little life unfolds yanagihara brings into the fold other characters of importance including a doctor andy contractor and a former law professor harold stein and his wife judy all of whom play important roles in in the novel as well as a host of minor characters it is however the four friends who remain central to the story especially jude and willem roommates in college and who remain the closest of the friends the bulk of yanagiharas novel is told in chronicle order but as the novel progresses there are more flashbacks and memories some of which get repeated with added detail as they surface most of them revolving around jude who becomes more and more the novels central characterwhen thinking about tragic characters in prose fiction no one comes my mind as being more tragic than jude fawley from thomas hardys jude the obscure which may be the motivation for the authors name for her main characterjude the patron saint of lost causes although readers soon come to the realization jude is a physically and emotionally scarred individual yanagiharas revelations about the details of judes history are painfully slow in comingmirroring the complexity and rawness of those very memories which haunt and torment jude they are memories which have shaped or rather distorted his life in one flashback the author reveals twentyfive years in the past ana judes now deceased first and only social worker warning jude during a hospital stay you have to talk about these things while theyre fresh or youll never talk about them and its going to fester inside you and youre always going to think youre to blame youll be wrong of course but youll always think itthere are relatively few highs in judes life and when they occur the reader is bound to find them tearful moments of joy the increasingly close friendship between jude and willem with both of them at the zenith of their careers is complexfilled paradoxically with the bounty which human relationships can contain along with enormous peril unfortunately most of judes life is a series of unrelenting dreadful terrifying shattering lows and betrayals accompanied by selfdestructive impulses which become worse and worse adding to a mans already burdensome childhood youth and lifelong posttraumatic stress judes is a portrait of suffering beyond comprehension and the brutal perpetrators of his torments throughout his life are the epitome of unfathomable monstrous human behaviorthus a little life does not make for easy reading it is emotionally jolting and at the same time riveting so vivid are yanagiharas expose of the quartet of characters the reader becomes one with them making it a quintet the authors characters are real to life the dialogue is vivid and genuine and the quality of the writing as well as the tone of the novel is unswerving although yanagiharas central characters meet with sometimes staggering personal and professional successes there are also failures and tragedies both past and present and always a dire cloud which encircles them all especially jude due to her immense and encompassing narrative skills readers will eventually brace themselves so that whenever a horrifying revelation is made about judes secret past or his present there is likely worse to comea narrative trick yanagihara pulls a little over a quarter of the way into the novel and again at the halfway point moving from an omniscient narrator to what clearly is a first person although not readily identifiable narrator is bound to strike the reader as both curious and possibly even portentous it is left up to the reader to recognize and interpret for themselves the meaning of the authors temporary changes in point of view she does the same switch near the books conclusion which eventually brings the work to its shocking climax and even more emotionally numbing traumatic endclearly a little life is not for everyone even though the novel is a modern masterpiece of writing and prose fiction and a work which will haunt the reader for a long time the most resilient reader may very likely find there are times when they simply must close the book and exit the bleakness of the world yanagihara creates before picking the book up again others may discover there are times when they simply want to throw the book across the room some readers may find the book impossible to finish because it is so emotionally draining regardless of the readers reaction to the novel a little life is an incredible accomplishment and a work which haunt the reader for a long timenotes a little life has recently been declared one of the best novels of the decade by emily temple for the literary hub on december the books cover photo is from a series of photos taken in the s by peter hujar the photo is titled orgasmic man the photo is purposefully ambiguous is the man depicted experiencing joy or pain a stage adaptation of a little life ran in amsterdam in and with limited runs only most of which were in dutch,positive
a little life,a little long,4,this is a novel that requires patience commitment and perseverance not just because of its length pages but because it doesnt exactly grab you swiftly it took me almost pages to feel installed in the story rather than just a visitor hovering outside the narrative yanagihara is longwinded although not generally dull yet she also in my opinion only fully realized one character jude st francis the successful but troubled ivy leagueeducated lawyer with a tragic troubled past the mostly interior story is ostensibly about these four friends who meet in their teens and their ongoing friendship for over thirty years but really it is a profile of jude with some shared traits of the obscure onejude was ritually abused as an orphan although the author is quite circumspect about the details which take of the novel to completely fill in and even then theres always more however even before i was enervated by the laboriously slow reveal the reader gets itthis isnt exactly new stuff for our topical times but it always dismays us to hear about disturbed violent people who abuse children by the time she filled in the shocking details i was astonished yes but also a bit wearytheres also a lot of repetition of judes adult coping behaviors in ways almost as horrifying as the abuse but necessary i suppose to really be intimate with his ongoing struggles to demonstrate the limitless loneliness and pain one suffers when life is clouded by shame but i admit to some impatience too i was straining to believe that everyone was always therapeutic with jude he was glum and intractable refusing to talk about his past with a few people he revealed bits and piecesbut as i said their ability to be so willing and available for jude was really too good to be true rarely they lost patience carefully manipulated by the author to usually further the story along and judejudes three friends ones he has known since collegewillem the successful actor malcolm the successful architect and jb the successful artist actually all the characters in this book are so highly successful as to be almost untouchable no pun intended start out as developing characters and then slip into either straw men andor saints then there is andy the virtuous and always available surgeon and harold the law professor with the patience of job all these men with one seeming exceptionjb who makes a few mistakes are so thoroughly unerringly and impossibly pledged to jude that it eventually strikes a false note all of these very busy peopleworld travelersseem to have dropeverything time and an almost pious forbearance for jude the enigmatic one who refuses to reveal his past and his harrowing abuses there were virtually no female characterswell harolds wife julia and malcolms wife but they were nothing but generic passersby even if like julia they played an important role they were all tools for the character of judeif i were to name a second welldeveloped character it would be the setting no matter how many books are set in new york city there are as many ways and more to bring it alive yanagihara has a sharp eye for living spaces architecture color and art and in this way she gave new york its singular charisma i would also assert that having an architect and an artist as two of judes friends allowed her to buttress the book with her eye for these details which i enjoyed greatly jbs installations of course mostly about jude or himself and conveniently about the other friends for later absorption added shade to the story but again it seemed that everything was for judes characterthis is a mostly interior novel which is why i demand either faceted characters or compelling ideas the author flirts with ideas through the art world but theres nothing inherently philosophical about the novel moreover the author gave all the other characters except for jude short shrift willem actually starts out engaging his childhood was also tragic but for different reasons yet too soon willem turns into a big movie star and his character a cursory device for jude willem is the most saintly of all the characters an actor who is never selfabsorbed who isnt even aware of his fame when he walks into a room hes portrayed as way too humble to be organicmost of the men in this novel made me think of those seurat paintings where the people whose faces we never see too well are diminished or faded into the background is that what the author intended i dont think so because in her debut book the people in the trees she had several wellrealized characters moreover in pages she includes judes friends frequently but the more they are present the more absence i felt of their true natures she also covered the topic of child abuse in both novels but in trees its for the reader to ascertain over the course of the suspenseful story whether the narrator is reliable or not and if the child abuse really did take place in a little life we know it took place and we follow the abused child mostly as an adultjust a side note yanagihara tends to pair abuse with a life of privilege in the people in the trees the alleged abuser is a scholarscientist in this second book the victim of abuse grows to be in the elite i would like to see her take it down a notchshow how many abused children are stuck in the system or live in the real world as a worker bee not touched by highbrow living and too impaired to put together a successful life jude however is an accomplished pianist with a beautiful voice is wellread a superior cook and is what i would identify as that rare contemporary renaissance manbut he works as a corporate lawyer hoursweek where his troubles seem to melt away on the jobregardless of the flaws i stuck with the novel jude was so captivating even in his reticence that i wanted to see it through i think yanagihara could have shaved off a few hundred pages without hurting the narrative especially as she didnt seem intent on filling out the characters beyond a certain pointat the beginning there was evidence that there would be nuance regarding race and sexual orientation a few comments were made at the start coyly referring to the fact that only willem is white jude was undetermined a mix of backgrounds and malcolm and jb were black so why a white man on the cover of the book is that supposed to be willem that seems disingenuous to me as the main character jude is not caucasion that was just one of the several manipulations that seemed inorganicalso there seemed to be little or no controversy about gay issues some of the characters were gay or bi but they didnt seem to go through any hardships past or present with their sexual orientation it was so smooth that it was glossed over parentsproud and accepting peersproud and accepting colleaguesproud and accepting nothing in these mens lives stirred any controversy or hardship unless it has to do with their relationship with judejust success even jbs problems were disposed of quickly but i suppose if you are in the being black and gay buys you a ticket from discrimination these men had a paved avenue so much more than my black andor gay friends ever did however her prose was always strong solid subtlehe imagined jude as a magician whose sole trick was concealment but every year he got better and better at it so that now he only had to bring one wing of the silken cape he wore before his eyes and he would become instantly invisible even to those who knew him best stars,positive
a little life,i would say that i do recommend this book but absolutely not to everyone,4,are you happy he once asked jude they must have been drunki dont think happiness is for me jude had said at last as if willem had been offering him a dish he didnt want to eat but its for you willem a little life by hanya yanagiharain this story we follow the lives of four friends malcom jb willem and jude living in new york over the course of four decades through addiction success and pride they are all tethered by their shared devotion to one of them jude st francis is a brilliant lawyer a talented pianist a generous friend but deeply troubled and scared there are secrets from his past that he holds so close keeping them even from his friends that slowly unfurl in the most heartbreaking and gut wrenching wayhow someone who is so loved reassured and supported by the people that surround them can still be convinced that they are unworthy of such love and normalcy is a true testament to how debilitating and damn near irreversible some traumas can be i cried for jude i was livid for jude i was in awe and proud of jude but i was also frustrated with jude i wanted to dive into the pages and try to convince him myself how unimaginably brave and deserving he was of all the good fortune he had found after his dark years to tell him its not his fault no matter your thoughts on the ending of this book it is undeniable how profound and harrowing its story is such a story leaves an impression on the brainmy only complaints about the book are i truly feel it was too long and too repetitive as well as the punctuation through me off quite a bit because it lacked in consistency here and there i also really really wish there had been more of jb and malcom as the book mostly centers around jude and willemi would say that i do recommend this book but absolutely not to everyone please please do not read this book if you are not doing well mentally as the triggers are aplenty,positive
a little life,stars excruciating and diabolical but masterfully written,5,i finished hanya yanagiharas emotionally draining a little life over three months ago and in the time since i felt i needed to recover from her roller coaster of a novel imagine though a roller coaster that is on fire but has classical music playing on its back row as it dips and ascends into screaming terror and melancholic euphoriaupon completing this novel i was fatigued drained and spent of my emotions because i have never equally hated and admired a book so much in my literary life on two occasions while reading i took a shot of tequila to get through particular sections sections where when the tequila did not help i put the book down because the books content read like being hit by a mack truck at full speed nothing in this novel is subtle as a matter of fact i equate reading it to a jackhammer puncturing hardbaked cement and you the reader is the cement the storytelling is piercing with plangent themes that gutted my insides and it is so visceral that it ostensibly paints yanagihara to be a sadistic fiend for unleashing a literary work such as this shes of course not shes simply a good writer who knows how to bring a heartbreaking story to lifeyes a little life is an agonizing read but one that was masterfully written offering all manner of literary rewards employing use of a dense particularized writing style yanagiharas prose is architectural cerebral and drawn out at a pace that is like molasses rolling up a sand dusted hill from page one i found the four protagonists to be engaging but forebodingly so where i immediately knew that there will be a lot to unpack in the subsequent pages ahead though the novels setting is contemporary yanagihara tells it in an odd but effective flashback mixed with present day style where the context of time is always abstract specific dates or years are never used instead we get descriptors such as nine years ago on his fifth birthday four years after this approach bothered me initially because it made some of the flashback scenes less textural but yanagihara is such a good writer she made the technique work as it became tolerable as i read on again nothing in this novel is subtle or plain but despite the elaborately detailed descriptions which i admired the novel is readable although i think some readers may find it to be ploddingfor me i think one of yanagiharas strength as a writer is her ability to flesh out characters as if they were filigree branching them out far and wide but characters that have a centered yet deeply flawed souls as well written as each of the characterizations are here i admit that i dislike every one of them the four protagonists jude willem jeanbaptist and malcolm plus two major secondary ones andy and harold all made my emotions seesaw from vexation to sympathy but mostly vexation jude the center of the novels story is especially maddening he is a self imposed martyr at times grating and is in constant need of attention attention that is wanted or not yet i couldnt help but be heartbroken for him due to his disquieting childhood and unenviable lot in lifeanother source of frustration was that a little life has in my opinion an uncomfortable air of incestuous camaraderie between the six protagonists a bothersome codependency that drove me up the wall everyone in judes life willem jeanbaptist malcolm andy and harold individually and collectively coddle him to such an extant that it borders on criminal i was bothered that each of these characters allowed their hubris and selfishness to take precedence over the necessary tough love that jude needed the enabling and coddling became reductive and peeved me so badly that i yelled out at my book several times still despite my irritation at the imbecilic actions of the characters i couldnt help but regress into pity and gutwrenching grief for each of their lives eventually my dislike of the characters became irrelevant as i dont think characters have to be likable in order to be effective at any given time i was mad at each of them but in their frustrating behavior they made me think long and hard about human frailtydespite my frustrations and even at densely packed pages a little life is a worthy read make no mistake as it did me this is a novel that will peel your insides and likely wreck you there were moments where i could only read certain chapters in short spurts with breaks between paragraphs because the content is so unsettling nevertheless i read it all because even though this is a fictional story i cant help but think that it is the life that some unfortunate souls have lived and or are living right nowi highly recommend a little life but again be warned the content is visceral excruciating and unrelenting the depravity and evil that yanagihara has showcased in these pages is unreal and is unlike any ive ever read as you progress though the novel prepare yourself before reading pages the entire book is not easy to get through but these pages are especially ungodly i dont care who you are or how strong you are i think this book is one that will wreck most i give it stars out of for the writing the themes and the fleshed out characterizations even though the novel as a whole is positively diabolical,positive
a little life,heartbreaking but beautiful,5,i rarely come across a book that lingers with me for a time but this book and willem and jude and their story haunt mei honestly can say i dont think ive cried as much or felt a characters heartache and pain as much as i felt for jude and willem a true testament to beautiful writing and the depth of this noveli can say that it is one of my favorite novels i have ever read but i do not know if i could ever sit and reread it for it is too fresh and still too rawhauntingly beautiful but not for the faint of heart,positive

a little life,this book should come with trigger warnings,5,i deeply loved this book but my mental health was not ready for it i feel like this book should come with a trigger warning for sadness i will be processing this book for years and probably still shed tears for the constant trauma jude was tormented with im so glad i read it but not sure i was ready for it i usually share my books with friends but im not ready to discuss this book with anyone,positive
a little life,hard read heart breaking excellent book,5,this book took me almost months to read not because it didnt hold my attention but because it is heavy and i just needed to take my time this book will stick with me for the rest of my life i cannot say that i recommend this book as im not sure i could be responsible for doing so to anyone however if you need a deep emotional heart wrenching book to read that will make you cry real tears and make you question if you can get through it well,positive

the four agreements a practical guide to personal freedom a toltec wisdom book,a trip into mysticism,4,the four agreements by don miguel ruiz the fifth agreement by don miguel ruiz and don jose ruiz i decided to review or summarize these books together because the fifth agreement is very much a continuation of the first book and in fact reiterates much of the earlier text both are based on the philosophy of the toltec ancient people of southern mexico who were known as women and men of knowledge before delving into the books i should acknowledge that i found then somewhat difficult although i have read a great many of what i would call spiritual books and wrings in the recent years these readings although similar were a bit more difficult to fully digest the author at times anticipates such problems on the part of the reader and is indeed accurate in that regard the toltecs were not a race or tribe or nation but scientists and artists formed to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the ancient ones they came together as masters naguals and students at teotihuacan the ancient city of pyramids outside mexico city and known as the place where man becomes god the toltec recognize that some years ago a human studying to be a medicine man woke to the realization that everything is made of light and that all that exists is one living being and that light is the messenger of life because it is alive and contains all information he called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual and knew what created the harmony between the two is life or intent he saw himself in everything in every human every animal every tree in the water the clouds and the earth as i read the book this seeing this realization is the truth is pure love and pure light it is this truth that we much search for but why must we search if such truth is everywhere we must search because we have lost the truth when we are born devoid of language we are the truthour presence is a miracle we feel and see what is without interpretation or judgment but as we grow we are what the author calls domesticated just as animals are the truth that we feel is replaced by symbolswords that are mere illusions that are opinions grafted onto objects and feelings we apply our attention the ability to discriminate and focus only on what we want to perceive on these symbols as children we believe what adults say especially our parents and our world becomes a dream a reality built on symbols from others not the silent feelings and observations that we experienced as infants and this learned realityour dream tells us how to behave in society what to believe and not believe what is acceptable and not acceptable what is good and bad right and wrong beautiful and ugly we are imperfect because we do not measure up to an image of perfection that has been imposed on us by others and we accept such law and structure by a system of reward for doing what is right and punishment for doing what is wrong this acceptance reflects a multitude of agreements we have made with our world we are judged and punished and then punish ourselves for bad behavior we become victims who carry guilt for such failures and are punished again and again whenever we are reminded or remind ourselves of such failures we live in a dream ruled by fear and filled with emotions of anger jealousy envy and hate we must be right and prove others wrong our mind and our world become a foga mitote a dream where a thousand people talk at once and no one understands the author feels that as a result we are living in a dream of hell we then search for the truth for a way out of this hell and yet the truth is already within us we dont have to search we just have to uncover what is part of us already as it was when we were born to escape our dream of hell we must break the old agreements that are fear based and reclaim our personal power we must create a new dream our own dream our personal dream of heaven the author suggests four basic agreements that you must make with yourself to reclaim your own power and find a heaven on earth a life of joy and fulfillment the first agreement be impeccable with your word the author feels that this first agreement is the most important and powerful i noticed a few things about the wording first he uses the singular word rather than words i think perhaps this is in deference to the use of such term in the bible where john speaking of creation says in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word is god through words you express your creative power but he obviously means the plural that your use of language must be impeccable the use of impeccable is also interesting our common definition of impeccable is faultless or flawless but it also means incapable of sin or without sin it is this meaning that the author employs he feels that a sin is anything that goes against yourself and being impeccable is not gong against yourself taking responsibility for your actions but not judging or blaming he says that if one loves him or her self then he or she will express that love in interaction with others and will thus be impeccable with the word because such word such action will produce a like reaction he contrasts words coming from love with those coming from what he calls black magic he feels that gossip is the worst form of black magic for it is judgmental language about others even those we do not know it is emotional poison that we teach to our children and friends and loved ones through our use of such criticism the word is too often used to blame to criticize to find guilt and destroy he gives the simple example of a child being told by her mother to shut up her singing because her voice was ugly the child obviously agreed with her mother and thus made an agreement with herself not to sing any more these are the type of agreements that we make in life that are harmful and destructive that lead us into our dream of hell instead when you are impeccable with your words they are no longer fertile ground for gossip and criticism but for love and as you use such words first by expressing love for yourself you break all the many agreements that make you suffer and begin to build your own dream of heaven on earth i dont read impeccable to mean absolutely honest for there are times when being absolutely honest could be counter to your words coming from love the second agreement dont take anything personally this is much easier said than done and i also think that the author assumes that one is practicing impeccability in their word before adopting this he basically feels that people take things personally because we assume that things said are truly about us and that we are prone to believe them in fact he feels that people do not do or say things because of us but because of themselves also whatever they do or say is a product of their own belief system of their own personal dream thus what they may think about me is not about me but is about them instead of accepting this we resort to the need to be right and show the other wrong so we magnify the power of their words or deeds if instead we always act from a sense of lovethe impeccability of our word then if someone is mad at me then i know that he or she is mad at him or herself and i am just the excuse for their anger when you stop taking things personally you can keep your heart open and not be harmed you will not need to trust in what others do or say but only trust yourself to make responsible choices and you must remember that neither praise nor criticism is to be taken personally because it is not about you but the speaker as i said at the outset of my comments on this agreement i think in discussing this agreement that the author assumes that he is impeccable with his word if not then how could he say that when someone gets mad at you they are mad at themselves this may still be true even if you were not using your word impeccably but it would be harder to accept especially since in his discussion of impeccability the author says that one must take responsibility for his actions wouldnt this mean that when we are less than impeccable that we must accept some consequence but not punish our self endlessly couldnt someones anger be about us if our word was less than impeccable but instead filled with the black magic mentioned by the author i raise these questions in my mind because at times as i read through this it sounds as if one can get a pass for less than sterling behavior because he need not take others reactions personally i dont think this is the authors message but it could be read into some of the philosophy the third agreement dont make assumptions the author starts off his discussion with this statement all the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personallyalthough i would question the use of the word all i have a hard time with such broad statements like all or none oralways or never i basically agree with his statement especially as it concerns emotional reaction to others true sadness from the passing of a child or similar objective tragedy is hard to relate to assumptions or taking things personally i have found that people often assume my meaning and sometimes take offense at something that was never intended to harm they probably misunderstood but as the author notes were afraid to ask for clarification and therefore filled in any uncertainty with an assumption i dont know exactly why we are afraid to ask for clarification maybe it roots back to those days when we were reluctant to ask questions in school maybe it a fear of being wrong even if it is a subjective response to another i dont know why we do such things but know that we do and that it causes great and unnecessary pain i think these two agreements about taking things personally and making assumptions are really part of a self centeredness that it is all about me we often tell people its not always about you but such words are almost in jest in fact it is really important to realize that it isnt always about you especially when the assumptions made generally do assume so and lead to taking things personally not making assumptions would seem to be one of the easier agreements to live up to as it only involves a little bit of inquiry but like any change it requires practice the author just suggests that you make sure the communication is clear if you dont understand ask have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be and even then do not assume that you know all there is to know about a given situationgood advice the fourth agreement is about the action of the first three always do your best the author stresses always doing your best but knowing that your best will vary from one moment to the next depending on how you feel etc but whatever your state you must always do your bestneither less nor more trying to do more than your best will cause you to spend unneeded energy and in the end your best will not be good enough you must be motivated to do your best not by some expected reward but by the love of what you are doing doing your best will help with the other three agreements and it will also make you feel better even if you suffer failures in the other three if you keep trying to do your best you will become a master of transformationpractice will make you the master always doing your best requires a great deal of effort if you break an agreement then you must be willing to begin again the next day and try your best to keep such agreement in reading the authors comments on this fourth agreement i am unsure whether he is relating doing your best to life in general or to the application of the other three agreements i see his book as being primarily focused on reaching an internal contentment and happiness not on navigating ones way through the world at large admittedly such inner contentment may well supply the path to successfully living in this rather complex world i just find a bit of a contrast between the focus of this work and something like falling upward by richard rohr where he acknowledges the need to survive in the competitive world as a means of gaining some level of confidence before in the second half of life we are able to discard much of the baggage of the first half and seek out a more personal and spiritual contentment of course this may be my misreading of both books but thats what an opinion is all about i also see a basic similarity between the two and among other spiritual pieces that i have read all see western culture as imposing and espousing a very competitive winloose guilt ridden mentality such mentality may or may not be necessary for the struggles that we face but all my readings seem to agree that at some point our thoughts need to focus on attaining a more peaceful and inclusive level of spiritual contentment this is the truth that the four agreements challenge you to seek the fifth agreement be skeptical but learn to listen as the author has pointed out we learn from symbols and these symbols do not represent the truth which is present in everything symbols are peoples interpretations of objects and feelings and are not the truth but are often lies thus it is important to be skeptical but he adds that you must then listen when you listen carefully to others you can then understand the symbols that they are using and understand their storytheir dream your communication improves and you can then see if what another is saying has relevance to you you do not have to believe their story for it is only symbols similarly you do not have to believe your own story for it is just made from your symbols neither story is the truth the truth simply is whether you believe in it or not it doesnt need you to believe for it simply is when you listen you dont have to form or express opinions you merely need to listen by merely listening you show respect for the other persons dream for the reality he or she has created the author sees all persons essentially as artists who create their worlds and they must be respected as such when we listen and share our stories we try to understand them and make them part or our stories if we so desireor not if you gain control over your symbols then what is left is the real you and the real you not your symbols makes your choices in trying to summarize what the author is saying i find myself struggling at times to get to the crux of his message i think that perhaps by expanding his work to this fifth agreement he intends to open the door to spread the wisdom of the four agreements to others the first four agreements taught us that out symbols are not the truth and that many of these symbolsour entire symbology as he calls it are lies that lead us to blame and shame and guilt to a living hell the four agreements help us escape this personal hell but perhaps there is more that we need to do the author expands his discussion to outline the different stages that we go through as we try to reach our heaven on earth he calls these steps attentions the first attention is the dream we create when we first use our attention to absorb the various symbols that we learn and we then believe such symbols represent knowledge and our reality he calls this first attention the ordinary dream of humans or the dream of the victims it is a dream of victims because we are the victims of the false symbols which form our reality and our reality is not about us it is a mirror reflecting what others expect of us and for us you must be freed of such reality and discover your true self then we reach a stage where we realize that our dream is a lie and we use the attention a second time to try to change our dream and create a new one this is the second dream of attention or the dream of the warriors because we now declare war against all the lies in our knowledge it is a war against that part of our mind that makes all the choices that guide us into our personal hell its a war between out true self and our belief systemwhat the author calls the tyrant or the big judge in this battle we fight to throw off the belief system that causes us to repeatedly punish ourselves for past wrongs the system that brings up past thoughts and punishes us over and over again the author notes that humans are the only animals on earth who punish themselves a thousand times or more for the same mistake and who punish everybody else a thousand times or more for the same mistakehe instead postulates that true justice is to pay once for every mistake as a warrior one fights to find his true self the author then notes that the dream of the second attention ends when something very important happens something called the last judgment this is the last time that we judge ourselves or anyone else its the day we accept ourselves just the way we are and everyone else just the way they are when the day of our last judgment comes the war in our head is over and the dream of the third attention begins we move from the dream of the warriors to the dream of the masters this is a dream of truth and respect and joy it is that point where we come back to our real state our divine self where we fell a communion of love with everything in existence when we learn that the symbols are not the truth then we are left to simply enjoy life as we did before the symbols ruled us we experience what he refers to as a resurrection and it allows us to be wild and free like a child except that we have freedom with wisdom instead of innocence at this point we dont need to judge ourselves or others we dont need to be right nor prove others wrong and we can express love with no shame or justification and walk in the world with our heart completely open this is the goal a life of joy these books express a philosophy couched in rather mystical termsin dreams and symbols attention and awareness but its message seems quite similar to other philosophies and much that is discussed in the current realm of what i will call a new spirituality it suggests a path to find our spiritual connectedness to all of the world around us a realization that we are each a part of everything and that everything is a part of us it reveals truth as not as description or a concept but something that simply is as the author points out the physical nature of a chair is truthits name is just a symbol a symbol that can take a myriad of forms i think he feels that a concept like goodness is also a truth that is intrinsically recognized and internal and not a product of a value system that is imposed on us by others as is love and beauty as do many others he lauds the innocence of childhood a time when the truth is real before we become domesticated he doesnt condemn such domestication he just says that it is because all of us have been indoctrinated and pass that knowledge on but at least to me he doesnt recognize such conditioning as being a necessary part of that portion of our lives when we must learn to cope in our world i think that this is the message that richard rohr sends in falling upward i can easily be misreading both but so be it the striking thing as i read numerous books and other writings and watch speeches is the basic consistency in the message of oneness and the need to abandon at least temporarily much of what we have learned in order to open our minds or perhaps clear our minds so that we can receive the gift of interconnectedness whether this is termed as experiencing heaven or nirvana or oneness is of no consequence these are just names for a realization of our humble and insignificant position in a broader more accepting and more loving world than most of us witness day to day,positive
the four agreements a practical guide to personal freedom a toltec wisdom book,this is not new age self help book this book is based on modern linguistic theory and philosophical precepts,5,i should start off by stating my background i am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics a branch of the humanities i also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity it has personally helped me triumph over many many challenges this is why i decided to write a review herethere is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems a belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language these instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive we are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccuratethe trouble is our belief systems are always inaccurate yes i used the word always for a reasonwithout going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics i will give you an overview herephilosophy when you study philosophy you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like is there a god or what is consciousness you may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs they even have a mathematical component called propositional logic where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates proofs but even proplogic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything in other words it isnt the answer eitherlinguistics when you study words and language you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never touch reality in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality posing as real i believe miguel ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as wellas his first agreement attests to the power of language the four agreements pulls heavily from saussure and derrida both saussure and derrida and many many others did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language the gist is this we have something called a symbol in our brain which is composed of two parts the word and the visual representation of the object look up semiotics for further detail these symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning then belief the unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up it isnt real our ideas of it arent realif you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems i recommend reading some of their academic essays or get rivkin and ryans literary theory books they are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole most of the essays are dense but worth the effortto simplify scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find the true belief for thousands maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth because of domestication we think other people have it but they dont truth is defined as that which has the most predictive power so far mathematics geometry and physics has the most predictive power our belief systems simply do notso any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false we cant know so why not pick something positive if no one knows anything then how can you even know anythingbut you dont need to study this yourself all you have to do is think back to your past self lets say ten years ago did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty how is that possible what about your future self will that person believe you have a faulty belief system probably how is this possible how can you be so wrong is it because you havent learned i highly doubt itbut we have to be right we are right at least we think we might be maybethe need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs we end relationships over it we storm out we write angry twitter updateshow this book has personally helped me no one persons opinion will ever again have the power to limit what i can do even if this person is an authority figure no one groups opinion will ever again have the power to limit what i can do no one has a clear idea of who or what i am not even me when people talk they are telling stories i dont have to argue i dont have to fight i simply have to listen wow i cannot comprehend another persons dream i cant mind read i cant assume i know nothing of their inner workings even scary aggressive people are just telling stories i no longer have to feel ashamed about who i am or what ive done or where im going its not my job to assign a story to my life or a judgment i no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love i just need to love who is willing to love back its so simple i take all gurus religions indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories i dont take myself as seriously as i used toprobably the most valuable of all i have a deep compassion for all people we are all just stuck here together trying our hardest and doing our best i dont have to hate someone because their best wasnt up to some story i tell myself i dont have to insist they believe in my story i can just smile and listen and do what i can,positive
the four agreements a practical guide to personal freedom a toltec wisdom book,simple but deep philosophy with the grandest of aspirations,4,the book has the boldest of aspirations attempting to be in the peer set of sacred religious foundations such as the bible the author believes we create our own hell and through practicing the agreements in this book could instead create our own heaven the core idea of reframing your mental state is well studied and backed up by science but the degree to which these agreements fulfill such lofty ambitious is an open question my take is that theres some wisdom that anyone could benefit from but theres a cloud of poor editing the reader must pass through to access itthe dream you are living is your creation it is your perception of reality that you can change at any time you have the power to create hell and you have the power to create heavenagreement be impeccable with your wordsimilar to the buddhist eightfold path right speech they mean speech that doesnt go against yourself this is both negative selftalk as well as unkind words towards others because that comes back against us if i see you in the street and i call you stupid it appears that im using the word against you but really im using my word against myself because youre going to hate me for this and your hating me is not good for me using the analogy of the human mind as a computer gossip can be compared to a computer virus a computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in but with a harmful intent this code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness after this code has been introduced your computer doesnt work quite right impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you you will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that ideaagreement dont take anything personallylike david foster wallaces this is water we have a rather selfish view that the world revolves around us instead we must love ourselves and refuse to take the poison others may inflict towards us even when a situation seems so personal even if others insult you directly it has nothing to do with you what they say what they do and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true therefore you dont need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally all the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personallyagreement dont make assumptionswe view the actions of others through a filter instead we can practice mindfulness and accept things as they are without associating baggage we make assumptions about what others are doing or thinking we take it personally then we blame them and react by sending emotional poison with our word we only see what we want to see and hear what we want to hear we dont perceive things the way they areagreement always do your bestin every moment give it your best even the seemingly inconsequential you now give your all but note this is not about perfection we are human and can accept our actions as long as we try our best when you overdo you deplete your body and go against yourself and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal but if you do less than your best you subject yourself to frustrations selfjudgment guilt and regrets if you dont judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt blame and selfpunishment when you always do your best you take action doing your best is taking the action because you love it not because youre expecting a reward when you do your best you learn to accept yourself but you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes learning from your mistakes means you practice look honestly at the results and keep practicing you do your best because you want to do it not because you have to do it not because you are trying to please i make everything a ritual and i always do my best taking a shower is a ritual for me and with that action i tell my body how much i love itquotes that provide a summary of the authors views the best way to say thank you god is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment right here and now whatever life takes away from you let it go the real you is still a little child who never grew up sometimes that little child comes out when you are having fun or playing when you feel happy when you are painting or writing poetry or playing the piano or expressing yourself in some way these are the happiest moments of your life when the real you comes out when you dont care about the past and you dont worry about the future develop awareness of all the selflimiting fearbased beliefs that make you unhappy you achieve the mastery of transformation by changing the fearbased agreements that make you suffer and reprogramming your own mind in your own way going to the core of those agreements is what i call going into the desert when you go into the desert you meet your demons facetoface after coming out of the desert all those demons become angels happiness is a choice and so is suffering,positive
the four agreements a practical guide to personal freedom a toltec wisdom book,i found this enlightening,5,i really enjoyed this book ive read it multiple times and have decided to try and follow the suggestions to help my life be better in fact i took these four agreements and came up with six of mine own which im now using as i have found them and my studies to be conducive to becoming a happier human beingthe style of the book can be difficult for some people i suspect but i found i was easily able to cut through to the meanings as they apply in our modern world as a philosophy for life these are by no means bad agreements,positive

how to know a person the art of seeing others deeply and being deeply seen,an important book on an important topic taking a much needed skill building focus,5,david brooks is good at both reporting and synthesizing best current thinking here in this new book importantly he is driven also by his own learning i think of him as a reflective practitioner a fellow traveler this is a good book not a great book a star rating however for cleat intent and effort this is a big tent book full of breadcrumbs of learning and insight a book that will be relevant and helpful for many the best chapters go deep a single topic unpacked like empathy the chapters in part are substantive in this way on the whole however the book goes wide too wide in addressing a broad range of both personal and public civic concerns the civic focus requires separate treatment really a separate book also at times this book is both overwritten and underwritten a reporters dilemma hard to find the middle ground balancing theory and practice stories in brief at a deeper level i think the book lacks an idea architecture in many ways there is no integrating framework offered his illuminator frame partially does this but it is not fleshed out and defined rigorously enough the book is more akin to a reporters field learnings coupled with a graduate students enthusiasm the book has a palpable sense of discovery about it and offers us the promise of learning and seeing in new ways and indeed it does that brooks helps us us take stock and see in new ways learning these social skills and the seeing others skills more fully more attentively that brooks points to however is not easy i would have liked him to go deeper explaining how these skills are acquired and deepened that said i applaud brooks task and his field research and his own reflections he is a good role model in both his personal and professional life in the quest for lived wisdom see chapter what is wisdom this is a well intended effort at pulling together this book and his learnings finally his dedication to his deceased friend peter marks his best friend speaks volumes read chapter and his poignant recollections of his friend pitch perfect writing found here,positive

the psychology of money timeless lessons on wealth greed and happiness,a significant and badly needed contribution to the qualitative part of our financial life,4,from the first sentence to the last this book provides the latest and most uptodate evidence for financial literacys wholesome power to enrich your entire life the author tells stories to discover financial literacy and living a good life go hand and hand most financial books discuss the dominated and respected quantitative side the sophisticated science complicated formulas and mindnumbing statistics reading the traditional personal finance genres makes people erroneously think investors need to be intelligent and aggressive to invest successfullythe psychology of money is courageously different it is about life first and finances second dont we want to better understand our behavior our sense of ourselves and what makes us tick so we can achieve that vibrant and contented life i know i dothe author skillfully separates the easy part of discovering the investing process versus the hard part this may shock newbies but understanding the quantitative aspect of finances such as constructing a diversified portfolio of lowcost index funds is the easy part look it is not the little guy or gal versus the massively intimating stock market with the macho goal of beating the average returns instead this book is about understanding our behavior and the decisions we make to achieve a balanced and calm life with accepting reasonable stock market returns now thats the hard part but this author makes understanding our behavior achievable and interesting he accepts whatever skills experience or knowledge readers bring to the tablethe author brings up an ageold adage that we have been taught by our elders for generationsdont take things so personally with lifes many challenges and sometimes negative surprises isnt it about how we react that counts instead if we respond with wisdom gained from our experiences over the long haul the challenge itself will eventually be insignificantthe author explains that our reactive behavior whether the sudden death of a loved one a broken water pipe damaging our house or a stock market crash how we respond to each of these vastly different crises is no different as a reviewer of this outstanding book i took the liberty of interpreting the primary theme with my examples with the death of a loved one we can blame the doctors the hospital and isolate from friends and family and sob over beers for the rest of your life as a lonely and bitter widow or widower or you can blame the stock market your broker or valueless wall street for your portfolio loses for example it is well known that millions of investors reacted negatively for over a decade they sat out with their two to three trillion of the longest bull market in history because they lost money in the financial crisis so no matter what the experience isnt it always how we react this book would help those unfortunate investors pull themselves and their portfolio together to get back in the marketto bring mindfulness to our reactions the author talked about investors emotions attitude and temperament to be successful in this counterintuitive financial system is to be aware and insightful of this powerful psychological human potentialyour expectation of future returns the goldilocks principle doesnt have too high return expectations or too low but somewhere in between but what is a reasonable expected returnthe author reports one of the most significant facts of the entire book the united states stock market returns after inflation allow me to repeat according to the author our united states capitalistic system produces about return minus inflation since the s average inflation generates a total return of it is the law of averages and it is powerful if we know how to tap into it and to be satisfied with average returns it has been researched many times that too many investors fail to get average returns morgan explains how to harness this massive industry and what strategy will get you the average return the goal is to earn the average return over many years why two reasons return over inflation is a great return because our emotions will be spared the negative reactions from the massive swings volatility of the stock market which will set you up to panic and get outthis book will help you find that just right balance of your investments and your mind so you can sleep soundly with confidence and reach your financial goals over long periods of time there is no get rich quick scheme if a financial adviser or your best friend says that they can beat the averages walk away and never listen to that nonsensehousel encourages all investors by debunking one debilitating myth from the start all you need to be a successful investor is patience think long term and one tiny piece of mathematics the power of compound interest over decades you do not need an mba or a high iq in fact for the newbie financial reader with no financial background or smarts take heart you have an advantage he wrote ordinary folks with no formal financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligencethats me i have never taken a financial course in my life i flunked nd grade and i scored a lower than iq but i had a huge advantage because i majored in psychology knowing how my mind functioned i mitigated my return expectations of the market and drama during three of the biggest stock market crashes in history my expectations for growth and losses are reasonable balanced between stocks and fixed because i knew what the worldwide stock market returns since with my mind disciplined to stay the course forever and to do what i can docontrol the real deal by keeping expenses low and be extremely happy with reasonable returns i have perfect control by paying myself instead of some wall street mucky mucks yachtfor years seasoned investors poopoo psychology read the one and twostar reviews of this book there is at least one huge exception one of the most significant financial thinkers of the th century and the mentor and professor of warren buffett ben graham wrote said in the very first paragraph of his monumental page the intelligent investor little will be said here about the technique of analyzing securities attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and investors attitudes revised page the author had the great wisdom to cite a book titled enough by the legendary john bogle morgan tells stories of people hit it big in the billions it wasnt enough they want more and in the end they lost it all bogles most famous quote to get the market averages mentioned previously is to invest in the entire haystack do not look for the needlethe author makes an important statement that is long overdue and worth repeatingthe qualitative discussions of investing is more complicated than the quantitative discussions it is humans that make the decisions and do all the trading on the stock exchanges throughout the world last i heard humans have feelings housel says that science is exact and is governed by predictable physical laws molecules and atoms do not have feelings but millions of investors do sir isaac newton would agree he famously lamented after losing his investments to the south sea disaster in the th century i can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people knowledge of psychology and behavior will help you understand and protect yourself from the madness of peoplethe author covers a lot of ground because there is a lot of human behavioral and psychological constructs to explain luck vs skill attitude vs math being average vs being superior uncertainty vs certainty and confidence born from wisdom vs overconfidence born from recklessness are impossible to measure and explain the author correctly labeled these constructs soft skills hard skills are the math statistics graphs and tables luck attitude accepting average returns uncertainty longterm horizon and overconfidence are difficult to explain without emotional pushback from some investors most seasoned investors want to be intelligent act aggressive appear confident and look sophisticated and soft skills will not get them that image and beat the marketwe love to think successes originated on skills knowledge intelligence spreadsheets and math the most vital reaction to many seasoned investors is downplaying luck to investment success but morgan wont have it making money from stock and bond investing is being smart with the complicated reality we face and spreadsheet knowledge will not be enough that being lucky is part of the equation he admits that the luck factor is the question that might not be answered in our lifetimesin the meantime there is nothing wrong with being lucky the returns are green too but most seasoned investors feel insulted warren buffett always reports that he is an incredibly fortunate investor born in the united states i am lucky that i am alive after contracting stage two colon cancer twenty years ago any one of us could have been born in a small village in india in abject poverty a shantytown in lima peru or one of our countrys public housing projectsunfortunately i gave the book four stars there was one paragraph that does not belong in the book i was disappointed i agree that i might be petty but that paragraph doesnt make any sense because it doesnt follow the narrative throughout on page i rewrote here for those who use the indexing strategy especially bogleheadsthat doesnt mean index investing will always work it doesnt mean it is for everyone and it doesnt mean active stock picking is doomed to fail in general this industry has become too entrenched on one side or the otherparticularly those vehemently against active investingdid the author lose his psychology for a momenti scratched my head and seriously wondered has the author lost his mind what in the world motivated the author had to write this when he shares how he invests and its just like most bogleheads and myself invest with lowcost index funds i believe i can speak for most bogleheads of course we are vehemently against active investing its expensive and flawed is thoroughly agreed upon by genuine fiduciary financial advisers furthermore there are books peerreviewed academic articles and the bogleheads forum experiences of how successful the indexing strategy has been overactive management the author admits on the following page that of active managers fail to beat the averages the active management strategy has been proven dead for decades and the authors stories debunk active management over million investors have their seven trillion dollars with vanguard and tiaa we know that active managers from wall streets big banks and brokerage firms spend a lot of time sipping martinis on their yachtsother than that hideous paragraph the psychology of money is a fine book because it makes a huge contribution to financial discussions and what it means to be financially literate the qualitative argument of financial literacy is desperately needed in the financial world the quantitative argument is appropriate for constructing your portfolio and understanding how markets only return average for years i learned a ton by reading those books too but after that no amount of math sophistication financial engineering or science will protect investors from a bear market only what is between our ears will investors must get our heads behind the idea that we are up against a massive industry that wants to use our money to make money for themselvesthe industry is playing a totally different game different motivation and most important different life valuesthey spend in front of their powerful computers trading for two goals only bonuses and beating the averages i have one more example of luckwe are lucky that morgan housel wrote this important work it is not about looking at your finances searching for that investment gem that will make you rich quickly or to compete at the end of the day it is about doing our part in making the world a better place than it is now being generous to those in need be part of something bigger than yourself and spending quality time with family and friends,positive
the psychology of money timeless lessons on wealth greed and happiness,timeless nuggets of wisdom,5,psycholology of money timeless lessons on wealth greed and happiness by morgan housel is a timeless work about how our feelings emotions and interactions with money often results in different outcomes for different people because people are different so insights into how to think and behave about money is instructiveyou may think you dont have enough money to make a difference for your future i think this book will show you how even with those thoughts that you canothers may believe they have more than enough those too are risky thoughts and beliefsbecause people are different everyone should read this book to see what you uniquely learn about yourself and how you should think about moneychocked full of great insights to guide us allquotes that hit home from various chapters are presented below there are many more quotes possible but then youd miss the message between each quote i strongly suggest getting the book to see how these below snippets string together into a powerful story about how we think and behave towards money mattersquote your personal experiences with money make up maybe of whats happened in the world but maybe of how you think the world works luck and risk are siblings yes but i have something he will never have enough there is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you dont have and dont need the hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving billion of warren buffetts billion net worth came after his th birthday buffett began serious investing when he was years old his skill is investing but his secret is time thats how compounding works but good investing isnt necessarily about earning the highest returns because the highest returns tend to be oneoff hits that cant be repeated its about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time thats when compounding runs wild getting wealthy vs staying wealthy getting money is one thing keeping it is another planning is important but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan no one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are when you see someone driving a nice car you rarely think wow the guy driving that car is cool instead you think wow if i had that car people would think im cool humility kindness and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money money has many ironies heres an important one wealth is what you dont see past a certain level of income people fall into three groups those who save those who dont think they can save and those who dont think they need to save building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns and lots to do with your savings rate the value of wealth is relative to what you need past a certain level of income what you need is just what sits below your ego peoples ability to save is more in their control than they might think things that have never happened before happen all the time the thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound how for example prompted the federal reserve to cut interest rates which helped drive the housing bubble which led to the financial crisis which led to a poor jobs market which led to tens of millions to seek a college education which led to over a trillion dollars in student loans with a high percentage of default rates the correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising the most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary the end of history illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much theyve changed in the past but to underestimate how much their personalities desires and goals are likely to change in the future thus their history of change wont change anymore into their future every job looks easy when youre not the one doing it successful investing looks easy when youre not the one doing it hold stocks for the long run but do you know how hard it is to maintain a longterm outlook when stocks are collapsing price not dollars and cents its volatility fear doubt uncertainty all of which are easy to overlook until youre dealing with them in real time beware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are when investors have different goals and time horizons and they do in every asset class prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another because the factors those investors pay attention to are different the interesting thing about absolutely pessimistic stories is that their polar opposite forecasts of outrageous optimism are rarely taken as seriously as prophets of doom pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism progress happens too slowly to notice but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore the more you want something to be true the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true we dont know what we dont know coming to terms with how much you dont know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control and that can be hard to accept less ego more wealth if you want to to do better as an investor the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizonunquotetheres a lot of wisdom alone in the various quotes above theres even more wisdom reading how they string together to see the larger story line to understand your psychology of money applied in your own lifeeach person reading housels work will get something different out of it than someone else and each time you read it i suggest more than once you too will get yet still something else out of it,positive

the psychology of money timeless lessons on wealth greed and happiness,spend more time in pursuit of small personally appealing adventures and interests,4,housel is an award winning business writer with investing experience he covers a number of topics in investing with a slightly different slant he makes a good argument that many of us would be happier or more satisfied if we spend more time in pursuit of small personally appealing adventures and interests instead of pursuing more moneyhe quotes successful people on how they achieve balance for instance harry moskowitz nobel prize winner in economics for his work on risk and reward said that deciding how much of his funds to put into the stock market he visualized his grief if the stock market went way up and he wasnt in it or if it went way down and he was completely in it so he split his contributions between bonds and in equitiesexamples of other famous investors such as warren buffett who has one of the best investment records available he points out that one of the reasons for his great wealth is that he invested very early and has kept the money compounding over a very long period of time close to years besides being very very wealthy buffett still tap dances to work and has shown he still has the ability to learn new tricks in investingpart of the way he did this was to hang onto investments for long periods of time even with his exceptional skill at picking stocks and businesses it turns out that only about of hundred of investments resulted in very large profits it takes special ability to have large profits in a given investment and to continue to hold it even while it goes up and down the author doesnt give you much help in how to accomplish this featanother point is you get wealthy not by spending most of your money but by saving most of your money and letting it compound over long periods of time how much do you invest and how much risk do you take with most of the money depends on knowing yourself do you want to be in a position where you have enough cash so if the market goes down heavily and you have the courage you can invest that money in the investment youre interested in this is contrary to what most people do who are relatively fully invested near the top and then sell investments as the market goes down they are losing too much and sell usually at a substantially lower price than they bought the investment so you have to have enough money invested so that over the long term that it goes up enough to make you wealthier but not so much that you decide that youve lost too much and sell at a big loss added to the problem is the fact that just because a company has bounced up and down before doesnt necessarily guarantee that its going to bounce back again using low cost index funds generally evens out the ups and downs to some degreeknowledge of the history of economic investment results is helpful but fails to predict what is actually going to happen in the future part of being an investor is being able to predict how you are going to react to the worst and the best things that can happen to your investments one of the most important attributes is the ability to change your mind as the world around you changes the author includes many examples of how famous investors have coped with various problems and are quite informativeperhaps the most valuable lesson or example is the author and his wife decided early in their careers that economic freedom that is enough money to make their own choices later in life was worth doing they could live comfortably without the joy of doing everything you want immediately instead they saved all of the raises theyve gotten over the years of their income he doesnt give actual numbers or even percentages for savings but they are well towards their goal of complete financial independence a great feeling if you can do it without sacrificing things that you really enjoy like the author perhaps you enjoy reading walking and podcasts its a good starthis method is to invest in low cost index funds vanguard and basically hold forever or until his family retires a large part of my own portfolio follows the same plan and this has worked very well hope you all achieve it,positive

the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,a true masterpiece,5,i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved herthis is one of the best books ive ever had the privilege to read it is probably in the top five for best books ive ever read in my entire life i have been looking for a book like this my entire life and no combination of words im about to type and youre about to read is going to do this masterpiece justice but i will say that gabby joce amelie and elyse were all right and im so happy i listened to them because this book is worth every single ounce of hypeand when i say that this book is lifechanging i truly mean it this book is sold as a historical romance where you learn about a fictional famous old hollywood actress and all her marriages what you get is a book that stars a bisexual cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life her wife and when i say i cried during this book i truly mean that i probably need to buy a new copy because i was the biggest mess youve ever seenand it will be the tragedy of my life that i cannot love you enough to make you mine that you cannot be loved enough to be anyoneson top of this being a powerful book about race sexuality misogyny and having to conform to societies norms the true meaning i took from this book is that life is short so damn short and we shouldnt spend it pretending to be something we arent and we shouldnt spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our lovei didnt need boys in order to feel good and that realization gave me great powerwe follow evelyn from the very start losing her mother very young her body developing very quickly noticing others noticing her developing body marrying a man so she can leave the deadend city she grew up in so she can become something more evelyn is unapologetic with her actions and it is one of the most empowering things ive ever read she plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in and evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them toothis story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view one from monique grant who is a biracial white and africanamerican woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field and her life changes the day her editor tells her how evelyn hugo is demanding her and only her to write something for herheartbreak is loss divorce is a piece of paperthe other timelines are all the different times in evelyns life and the different seven husbands that she had while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling monique this story evelyn has lived a very full life and is in her late seventies now and is finally ready to talk about her life but the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only monique for this jobmake them pay you what they would pay a white manif you guys have been following my reviews youll probably know that i talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot but the seven husbands of evelyn hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be evelyn and harrys friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things ive ever read in my entire reading lifewhen you write the ending monique make sure the reader understands that all i was ever really looking for was family make sure its clear that i found it make sure they know that i am heartbroken without itand the romance the true romance in this book is the most romantic thing i have ever read in my entire life and you guys know ive read a ton of romances but they are all lesser to this every single one of them cant compare with the romance in this book i feel like every time ive used the word perfect to describe something that wasnt the romance in this book then i used the word wrongplease never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile at least to me it does youre the only thing on this planet worth worshippinghow many evelyn and celias are there in the world how many are still playing the role that evelyn was forced to play i cry for every single person who must hide who they are and who they want to love and this book talks about many big things in lgbtqiap history from the stonewall riots to the disgusting reagan administration but life still isnt anywhere close to equal in the prejudices the discrimination the virussyndrome blaming the looks ive experienced holding a girls hand while walking into a restaurant those are still in in the united states but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized begrudgingly im not writing this review to get on my soapbox but i promise we have a lot more work to do and this book this book lit a fire under mei personally identify as pansexual but i felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen seeing evelyn love all the parts of her and all the different parts of her love was something so aweinspiring i am still so overwhelmed with feelings but if you identify as bi or pan this is a love letter to you i promisei was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated methis book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book and then i read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again taylor jenkins reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me and i just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right nowthis was the first thing ive read by taylor jenkins reid but i will buy every single new thing she produces the writing was so lyrical and addicting i mean i have a quote between almost every paragraph this whole book deserves to be highlighted the characters well my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now so there is that the topics themes and discussions are beyond important this book just makes me feel so passionately this book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature ive ever consumed and i am not the same person i was before this booki told her every single day that her life had been the worlds greatest gift to me that i believed i was put on earth not to make movies or wear emeraldgreen gowns and wave at crowds but to be her motherif you guys ever take a recommendation from me please have it be the seven husbands of evelyn hugo please im actually begging you i promise this book is lifechanging and i equally promise you that this book changed mine there is magic between these fourhundredpages pure magic this story is addicting enthralling and so important and if youre an evelyn in i see you but i hope it doesnt take you as long as it took her to be happy this will forever be one of the best books of my life and ill cherish it foreverpeople think that

the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,the seven husbands of evelyn hugo masons review,4,people think that intimacy is about sex but intimacy is about truth when you realize you can tell someone your truth when you can show yourself to them when you stand in front of them bare and their response is youre safe with me thats intimacytaylor jenkins reids the seven husbands of evelyn hugo tells the authentic story of legendary hollywood actress evelyn hugo through an autobiographical medium with ambitious vivant journalist monique grant scribing her tale throughout the interview hugo reveals the behindthescenes secrets of her life acting in the film industry detailing how she repressed her cuban heritage to conform to the hollywood scene how she not only experienced but capitalized on the industrys sexism and double standards how she used her body and married famous men to get her to the top how she found true friendship and forbidden love and how she admits that she would do it all again if given a chance as hugo engrosses grant and the readers with her story the question of why would a famous hollywood actress want to speak with an upandcoming journalist like monique grant why her lingers in the back of our minds and soon we learn the real reason why hugo wanted grant to write her autobiography as a student enrolled in an intermediate fiction writing course i was particularly eager to review this novel after reading it for the first time last year to say that i thoroughly enjoyed reading it is an understatementtaylor jenkins reid never fails to impress me with her craft in creating and developing characters i find that to be a strong element of the novel that contributed to my appeal evelyn hugo is one of the most compelling protagonists i have ever read about in my entire life and i adored the fact that she was all morally shades of grey and not a good person when it came to her rise to the top of the hollywood ladder she felt no regrets about the manipulations and schemes she created to get her to the singularity which thrilled me but seeing her vulnerable side away from the flashing cameras was also a real treat harry cameron and celia st james serve as strong secondary characters who held a major influence on hugo one whom she shared a deep platonic connection with and the other to whom she was helplessly in love with and devoted taylor jenkins reid wonderfully illustrates the ups and downs of the friendship between evelyn and harry the struggles and clashes between evelyn and celia and the tragedy evelyn experienced losing them bothanother element that stood out to me was the setting of the novel hugos interview reveals how she built and stepped away from her career as a renowned hollywood actress often inspiring her to move across different locations to preserve her private image to her detriment and benefit the press follows hugo wherever she goes with journalist companies like sub rosa photomoment hollywood digest and the new york tribune writing articles about her fabricated life while not realizing it and spreading gossip seeing those newspaper clippings pop up in the chapters gives the novel a sparkling touch making the environment feel more authentic it also is no surprise that taylor jenkins reid took inspiration from old hollywood icons such as marilyn monroe and elizabeth taylor to craft the character of evelyn hugo she fits right into the time period where her story blossomsfinally the last element that stood out to me above all else was evelyns plot arc she goes from feeling determined to make it to the singularity and steal the audiences attention to wanting to give it all up for celia st james the love of her life in a way that feels so natural and real her wanting to build an image as a renowned actress came from wanting to get out of hells kitchen and prove to people especially her abusive father that she has the talent and worth to make it big but as she meets and falls for celia she feels compelled to spend every moment with her and she keeps up her work ethic but hides her feelings so the career she sacrificed so much of her authentic self for doesnt die in vain of course that comes with hardships in her relationship with celia but we see how her decision to leave all of the hollywood glory behind makes sense after the fact its bittersweetif youre in the market for a juicy contemporary beach read or a compelling novel that handles serious topics elegantly the seven husbands of evelyn hugo is worth a read and is the book for you,positive
the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,loved it,5,with so many heavy topics discussed in this book i really think taylor jenkins reid did a beautiful job showing us the complexities of each one of them along with the simple complexity of just being human this book covers the story of a woman from years old to her death at and everything that happened in between including what leads her to monique grant to write her memoirs ending the book with a connection between the two you will never see coming i never expected to relate to a movie star from the s but hearing evelyns story reminded me of my own life and its amazing how the author did that so beautifully,positive
the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,not what i was expecting,5,this is one of the better books ive read in a long time i belong to a book club so sometimes i dont read descriptions or reviews well before reading the book because im going to read it anyway but i was so pleasantly surprised by this it was deeper and i cared more about the characters than i thought i was going to great storytelling and this came out at the perfect time with so many stories of hollywood abuse coming out i would love to see this as a movie,positive
the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,finished in all in one day,5,i have never had a book reap such emotion from me i have never cried reading a book that being said it was only the end that made me cry no spoilers but chapter did it for me followed by immediate shock and the feeling of betrayalthroughout the course of the book i feel as though i felt the emotions evoked from each marriageevery lossevery slanderous word said of evelyn and while the book was focused around evelyns life and we received so little of monique i still felt that i knew her so well i mourned for her and celebrated her in the few chapters focused on her own lifei loved this book and have to place this in my top favorite books ive ever read perhaps maybe even only time will tell,positive
the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,hollywood hasnt changed much,5,starting at the young age of fourteen and ending when shes seventynine when we first meet evelyn evelyn hugo has gone from bombshell to sexpot to oscar winner to civil rights supporter evelyn knew what she wanted from an early ageto get out of hells kitchen and away from her abusive father and to be the biggest star anyone has ever heard of and she accomplished that partially because of her talent partially because she knows her worth and is unafraid to get dirty in order to achieve her goals and partially because there is no one better at using the press and scandals to serve their own interests evelyn is both a force to be reckoned with but also a deeply flawed and lonely shown through the perspective of evelyn as she dictates her memoir to monique the reader is taken back to the early days of hollywood to watch evelyns rise and her stumbles to and through stardom for a story about a hollywood starlet this book is layered and i dont think i was expecting the level of depth it had even though many reviews warned me to expect the unexpected with this storyin order to become evelyn hugo hollywoods biggest star evelyn had to let go of who she was erasing her identity to be what hollywood wanted her to be she knew and accepted this always but it does break your heart a little to watch her identity get stripped away so that she could be the blonde bombshell the screen so loved the things evelyn hid or changed often denying the realest parts of herself in the process really hit me in the feels and there were parts at the end of the book that had me welling up with tears if that tells you anything i wont say more because the way the story unfolds is really lovely with getting to know all of evelyns husbands and the roles they played in her life but i will say that i loved the inclusion of the fake articles to show the juxtaposition between what was evelyns reality versus what the public got to see and how the press portrayed her in returnhonestly there was very little i did not like about this book or its story it flowed beautifully and while not necessarily one of those books you couldnt put down i had no issues stopping in reading for the night it was never dull it had a smooth and highly enjoyable writing style however my only issues were that sometimes with the book being told in st person monique didnt always feel that distinct to me from evelyn which may be mostly because we dont really get to know monique at the same level at which we get to know evelyn though i did enjoy their relationship and how they were able to help each other even when that got tricky to say the least but i also didnt like celia for a majority of the book either i found her to be so frustrating at times that i often wondered why evelyn even bothered having her around thankfully that changed toward the end but stillbut all in all i loved this book and this story it was so empowering watching evelyn be so unashamed to own her beauty her sex appeal her confidence and to be the ballbuster she was so unafraid of telling people what she wants what she deservesall because she knows her worth i didnt know how much i needed a story to see a woman like that until i read this book but i also loved that the author didnt shy away from evelyns flaws or the fact that for a lot of evelyns life she was deeply lonely evelyn wasnt perfect but she didnt let that be an excuse for anyone to treat her poorly i will say there are some instances of spousal abuse in this book though so just be forewarned if that kind of trauma is sensitive for you i thought the author handled those topics amazingly well but ive also never experienced such things for myself either because this book brought tears to my eyes with that whole last third of the story it easily gets stars from me this is such a satisfying and empowering book,positive
the seven husbands of evelyn hugo a novel,i love this book,5,i could not put this book down i usually like thrillers and mystery books and wasnt sure id be into something like this but i was so wrong i went through this book like it was nothing the way evelyn tells her story is so captivating that even when i had to stop reading to participate i real life this book was all i could think about i was fully immersed i wish i could read it again for the first time,positive

outlive the science and art of longevity,wonderful mix of facts sound medical advice anecdotes and opinions for living a long healthy life,5,this book outlive the science and art of longevity by peter attia md with acknowledged contributions by others including bill gifford is a wonderful mix of facts medical advice personal and family anecdotes and opinions for living a long life that you your friends relatives and medical professionals will enjoy one main recommendation is to exercise regularly in specific ways while avoiding injury he recommends particular medical tests the book is worth purchasing and reading to understand how to live a longer healthier life as an example of the substance and style of this book attia writes the information and advice presented in this book are not meant to substitute for the advice of your familys physician or other trained healthcare professionals you are advised to consult with healthcare professionals with regard to all matters pertaining to you and your familys health and wellbeing attia writes as a surgical resident at johns hopkins i would learn that death comes at two speeds fast and slow ultimately slow deaths ended up bothering me even more but this is not a book about death but about longevity longevity does not mean merely notching more and more birthdays as we slowly wither away in life expectancy hovered somewhere south of age fifty and most people were likely to die from fast causes accidents injuries and infectious diseases the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that i call the four horsemen heart disease cancer neurodegenerative disease or type diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction longevity has two components how long you live and the quality of your years called healthspan defined as the period of life when we are free from disability or disease death rates from cancer on the other hand have hardly budged in the more than fifty years since the war on cancer was declared despite hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending on research type diabetes remains a raging public health crisis showing no sign of abating and alzheimers disease and related neurodegenerative diseases stalk our growing elderly population none of our treatments for latestage lung cancer has reduced mortality by nearly as much as the worldwide reduction in smoking that has occurred over the last two decades thanks in part to widespread smoking bans this simple preventive measure not smoking has saved more lives than any latestage intervention that medicine has devised medicines biggest failing is treating all these conditions after they are entrenchedrather than before they take root attia writes the metabolic derangement that leads to type diabetes also helps foster and promote heart disease cancer and alzheimers disease all diets are similar protein becomes critically important as we age exercise is by far the most potent longevity drug no other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function but most dont do nearly enoughand exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as good attia writes there have been two distinct eras in medical history and we are on the verge of a third hippocratess major contribution was the insight that diseases are caused by nature and not by the gods medicine arrived in the midnineteenth century with the advent of the germ theory of disease and eradicated deadly diseases such as polio and smallpox yet medicine has proved far less successful against longterm diseases such as cancer lifespans have nearly doubled since the late s almost entirely from antibiotics and improved sanitation if you subtract out deaths from the eight top infectious diseases overall mortality rates declined relatively little over the course of the twentieth century the goal of medicine is to be thriving throughout the latter half of our lives lifespan is binary youre alive and then youre dead its final but before that happens most people suffer through a period of decline that is like dying in slow motion while actual death is inevitable this deterioration is less so if you increase your muscle strength and improve your cardiorespiratory fitness you have also reduced your risk of dying attia writes exercise components are strength stability aerobic efficiency and peak aerobic capacity we want to maintain physical strength stamina stability across a broad range of movements while remaining free from pain and disability exercise is the most potent longevity drug in our arsenal in terms of lifespan and healthspan the data are unambiguous exercise not only delays actual death but also prevents both cognitive and physical decline better than any other intervention attia writes data comes from studies of people who have lived to the age of one hundred and beyond often in good health many of them get to enjoy one or two or even three bonus decades researchers found that individuals had very little in common with one another genetically natural selection has endowed us with genes that work beautifully to help us develop reproduce and then raise our offspring but after the age of reproduction natural selection loses much of its force yet a handful of potential longevity genes are possibly relevant to our strategy one gene called apoe apolipoprotein e that is involved in cholesterol transport and processing and it has three variants e e and e the e variant of apoe seems to protect its carriers against dementiaand it also turns out to be very highly associated with longevity foxo belongs to a family of transcription factors which regulate how other genes are expressedmeaning whether they are activated or silenced when foxo is activated it in turn activates genes that generally keep our cells healthier it seems to play an important role in preventing cells from becoming cancerous as well attia writes gene expression can be influenced by your environment and your behaviors a study found that older people who were put on a regular exercise program shifted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression after six months this suggests that genetics and environment both play a role in longevity and that it may be possible to implement interventions that replicate at least some of the centenarians good genetic luck think of centenarians as the results of a natural experiment that tells us something important about living longer and living better the experiment entails taking a random collection of human genomes and exposing them to a variety of environments and behaviors the centenarians possess the correct combination of genome x required to survive in environment y perhaps with help from behaviors z attia writes protein aggregates have been implicated in diseases such as parkinsons and alzheimers disease so getting rid of them is good impaired autophagy has been linked to alzheimers disease and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als parkinsons disease and other neurodegenerative disorders by cleansing our cells of damaged proteins and other cellular junk autophagy allows cells to run more cleanly and efficiently and helps make them more resistant to stress the fda has given the green light for a clinical trial of another drug with potential longevity benefits the diabetes medication metformin studies appeared to confirm that patients on metformin appeared to have a lower incidence of cancer than the general population diabetics on metformin actually lived longer than nondiabeticsstriking attia writes in the late s the average american adult male weighed pounds now the average american man tips the scale at nearly pounds according to the cdc more than percent of the us population is obese another third is overweight bmi of to visceral fat is linked to increased risk of both cancer and cardiovascular disease fatstorage capacity seems to be influenced by genetic factors our metabolism as it has evolved over millennia is not equipped to cope with our ultramodern diet which has appeared only within the last century or so we needed to endure periods of time without much food and natural selection obliged endowing us with genes that helped us conserve and store energy in the form of fat to survive periods of famine cold climates and illness and pregnancy attia writes at some point our primate ancestors underwent a random genetic mutation that effectively switched on their ability to turn fructose into fat this newfound ability to store fat enabled them to survive in the colder climate but in our modern world this fatstorage mechanism has outlived its usefulness it is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples for example because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly mixed with fiber and water and we can handle it normally i test my patients levels of uric acid not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure while heart disease is the most prevalent agerelated condition it is also more easily prevented than either cancer or alzheimers disease atherosclerotic disease still kills more people than cancer in the us each year heart disease remains our deadliest killer but this should be the tenth leading cause of death not the first attia writes the reason theyre called highand lowdensity lipoproteins hdl and ldl respectively has to do with the amount of fat relative to protein that each one carries its not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which its transported another major misconception about heart disease is that it is somehow caused by the cholesterol that we eat in our diet the humble egg has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol and particularly egg consumption may not have much to do with heart disease at all the vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells dietary guidelines finally conceded in that cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption glad we settled that the american heart association guidelines still favor ldlc testing instead of apob i have all my patients tested for apob regularly and you should ask for the same test the next time you see your doctor we are fortunate that many of these conditions can be modulated or nearly eliminatedincluding apob by the wayvia lifestyle changes and medications i take a very hard line on lowering apob the particle that causes all this trouble in short get it as low as possible as early as possible if we all maintained the apob levels we had when we were babies there wouldnt be enough heart disease on the planet for people to know what it was in my clinical experience about a third to half of people who consume high amounts of saturated fats will experience a dramatic increase in apob particles which we obviously dont want monounsaturated fats found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil macadamia nuts and avocados among other foods do not have this effect the point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile but for many patients lowering apob cannot be accomplished with diet alone statins are far and away the most prescribed class of drugs for lipid management statins are very helpful drugs for reducing apob or ldl concentration in many patients for people who cant tolerate statins i prescribe bempedoic acid nexletol attia writes like heart disease cancer is a disease of aging that is it becomes exponentially more prevalent with each decade of life there were more cancer deaths among people between fortyfive and sixtyfour than from heart disease the problem we face is that once cancer is established we lack highly effective treatments for it our toolbox is limited surgery is of limited value when cancer has metastasized or spread metastatic cancers can be slowed by chemotherapy but they virtually always come back cancer cells stop listening to the bodys signals that tell them when to grow and when to stop growing a gene called pten which normally stops cells from growing or dividing and eventually becoming tumors is often mutated or lost in people with cancer including about percent of men with prostate cancer and percent of men with advanced prostate cancer such tumor suppressor genes are critically important to our understanding of the disease not only is breast cancer genetically distinct from colon cancer as the researchers expected but no two breast cancer tumors are very much alike with a few exceptions solid organ tumors typically kill you only when they spread to other organs prostate cancer kills only when it becomes metastatic once cancer has spread the entire game changes excess weight is a leading risk factor for both cancer cases and deaths second only to smoking obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers for colorectal cancer crc about percent of people who are diagnosed with crc before the age of fifty have no family history or hereditary conditions linked to the disease of all the horsemen cancer is probably the hardest to prevent attia writes in the us about million people are diagnosed with alzheimers disease million have been diagnosed with parkinsons exercise is the only intervention shown to delay the progression of parkinsons having type diabetes doubles or triples your risk of developing alzheimers disease about the same as having one copy of the apoe e gene apoe e seems to accelerate other risk factors and driver mechanisms for alzheimers curiously apoe e was not always a bad actor the e mutation showed up about years ago while e is a relative latecomer arriving only in the last years in environments where infectious disease was a leading cause of death apoe e carriers may have been the lucky ones in terms of longevity the single most powerful item in our preventive tool kit is exercise strength training is likely just as important i now tell patients that exercise is the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit sleep is also a very powerful tool against alzheimers disease sleep disruptions and poor sleep are potential drivers of increased risk of dementia there is a growing body of research linking oral health with overall health the conundrum we face is that our environment has changed dramatically over the last century or two in almost every imaginable wayour food supply and eating habits our activity levels our genes no longer match our environment thus we must be cunning in our tacticsto thrive attia writes exercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your life even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years it delays the onset of chronic diseases pretty much across the board but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan so if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book it must be in the realm of exercise attia writes each of us needs to be training for the centenarian decathlon decide on the ten most important physical tasks you will want to be able to do for the rest of your life consider a long list of physical tasks that might include some of the following get up off the floor under your own power lift a twentypound suitcase into the overhead compartment of a plane from say more than fifty different items then select which of these tasks you want to be able to perform in your ninth decade then come up with a list of ten to become a different sort of athlete altogether an athlete of life i structure my training around exercises that improve the following grip strength to be able to lift the weight up and put it back down slowly and with control pulling motions hiphinging movements i focus on these four foundational elements of strength because they are the most relevant to our centenarian decathlon studies suggest that grip strengthliterally how hard you can squeeze something with one handpredicts how long you are likely to live its not about telling you what to eat its about figuring out what works for your body and your goalsand just as important what you can stick toattia writes nutrition is relatively simple dont eat too many calories or too few consume sufficient protein and essential fats obtain the vitamins and minerals you need and avoid pathogens beyond that we know relatively little with complete certainty read that sentence again please a lot of the old clich expressions are probably right if your greatgrandmother would not recognize it youre probably better off not eating plants are very good to eat animal protein is safe to eat we evolved as omnivores ergo most of us can probably find excellent health as omnivores attia writes some clinical trials have provided some useful bits of knowledge one of the clinical trials show a clear advantage for the mediterranean dietor at least for nuts and olive oil the study was meant to last six years but in halted it prematurely after just four and a half years because the results were so dramatic the group receiving the olive oil had about a onethird lower incidence percent of stroke heart attack and death than the lowfat group and the mixednuts group showed a similar reduced risk percent it was therefore deemed unethical to continue the lowfat arm of the trial by the numbers the nutsoroliveoil mediterranean diet appeared to be as powerful as statins attia writes sad the standard american diet is almost as devastating to most people as tobacco when consumed in large quantities the farther away we get from the sad the better off we will be the real art is finding the best mix of macronutrients and an eating pattern that one can sustain our four macronutrients alcohol carbohydrates protein and fat alcohol serves no nutritional or health purpose but is a purely hedonic pleasure that needs to be managed its especially disruptive for people who are overnourished its an empty calorie source that offers zero nutrition value chronic drinking has strong associations with alzheimers disease mainly via its negative effect on sleep it loosens inhibitions around other kinds of food consumption attia writes many studies have found powerful associations between insufficient sleep less than seven hours a night on average and adverse health outcomes ranging from increased susceptibility to the common cold to dying of a heart attack as important as sleep is for the body it may even be more so for the brain good sleep in terms of not only quantity but quality is critical to our cognitive function there is a growing body of evidence that sleeping well is essential to preserving our cognition as we age and staving off

outlive the science and art of longevity,the owners manual we should have received at birth,4,when we are born we arent given an owners manual but now we have the book outlive the science and art of longevity by peter attia md it provides direction for how we can live a long and healthy life but it also shares a prescription for the things we need to do if we want to live longer despite the diseases that are out to get us including cancer heart disease and type diabetesattia is well known for his medical advice on his podcast and in other venues this book cautions us about what he calls the four horsemen of diseases that are likely to kill us heart disease cancer neurodegenerative disease or type diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction despite limited progress in holding some of them back attia says modern medicine is still not very helpful until a disease is diagnosed before help is provided someone who drops dead of a heart attack did not just get sick an hour earlier he writes the disease was working inside them silently and invisibly for decades their internal defense mechanisms weakened as they grew older and disease gained the upper hand among the key takeaways from the book current medicine relies on two tactics procedures eg surgery and medications but he suggests that future medicine should focus on five domains exercise nutrition sleep emotional health and exogenous molecules meaning drugs hormones or supplements according to research by thomas perls of boston university and his colleagues who run the new england centenarian study one in five people in the general population will have received some type of cancer diagnosis by age seventytwo similarly onequarter of the general population will have been diagnosed with clinically apparent cardiovascular disease by age seventyfive among centenarians that prevalence is reached only at age ninetytwo when centenarians die they have generally though not always been sick or disabled for a much shorter period than people who died two or three decades earlier according to the centers for disease control cdc more than percent of the us population is obese defined as having a bmi greater than while roughly another third is overweight bmi of to statistically being obese means someone is at greater risk of chronic disease so a lot of attention is focused on the obesity problem but i take a broader view obesity is merely one symptom of an underlying metabolic derangement such as hyperinsulinemia that also happens to cause us to gain weight doctors should focus on metabolical obesity defined in terms of the following five criteria high blood pressure high triglycerides mgdl low hdl cholesterol mgdl in men or mgdl in women central adiposity waist circumference inches in men or in women elevated fasting glucose mgdl if you meet three or more of these criteria you have the metabolic syndromealong with as many as million other americans according to a article in jama about percent of the us population ticks at least one of these boxes metabolism is how we take nutrients and break them down for use in the body those nutrients are processed and sent to their proper destinations in someone who is metabolically healthy but when someone is metabolically unhealthy many calories they consume end up where they are not needed at bestor outright harmful at worst fat also begins to infiltrate your abdomen accumulating in between your organs patients with diabetes have a much greater risk of cardiovascular disease cancer alzheimers disease and other dementias one could argue that diabetes with related metabolic dysfunction is one thing that all these conditions have in common this is why i place such emphasis on metabolic health and why i have long been concerned about the epidemic of metabolic disease not only in the united states but worldwide humans have a unique capacity for turning calories from fructose into fat lots of people like to demonize fructose especially in the form of highfructose corn syrup without really understanding why its supposed to be so harmful the story is complicated but fascinating the critical factor here is that fructose is metabolized differently from other sugars when we metabolize fructose along with certain different types of foods it produces large amounts of uric acid best known as a cause of gout but also associated with elevated blood pressure cholesterol is essential to life it is required to produce some of the most critical structures in the body including cell membranes hormones such as testosterone progesterone estrogen and cortisol and bile acids which are necessary for digesting food the humble egg in particular was singled out in a proclamation by the american heart association accused of causing heart disease because of its high cholesterol content it has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol and particularly egg consumption may not have much to do with heart disease at all eating lots of saturated fat can increase levels of atherosclerosiscausing lipoproteins in blood but most of the actual cholesterol that we consume in our food ends up being excreted out our backsides the vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells nevertheless us dietary guidelines warned americans away from consuming foods high in cholesterol for decades and nutrition labels still inform american consumers about how much cholesterol is contained in each serving of packaged foods cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states right behind heart disease together these two conditions account for almost one in every two american deaths the difference is that we understand the genesis and progression of heart disease fairly well and we have some effective tools with which to prevent and treat it as a result mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease have dropped by twothirds since the middle of the twentieth century but cancer still kills americans at almost exactly the same rate as it did fifty years ago we have made some progress against a few specific cancers notably leukemia especially childhood leukemia as i noted earlier for adults with leukemia tenyear survival rates nearly doubled between and leaping from percent to percent survival rates for hodgkins and nonhodgkins lymphomas have increased as well especially the former yet these represent relatively small victories in a war that has not gone particularly well the problem we face is that once cancer is established we lack highly effective treatments for it our toolbox is limited many though not all solid tumors can be removed surgically a tactic that dates back to ancient egypt combining surgery and radiation therapy is pretty effective against most local solidtumor cancers but while weve gotten fairly good at this approach we have essentially maxed out our ability to treat cancers this way we are not getting any more juice from the squeeze i advocate early aggressive and broad screening for my patientssuch as colonoscopy or other colorectal cancer screening at age forty as opposed to the standard recommendation of fortyfive or fiftybecause the evidence is overwhelming that its much easier to deal with most cancers in their early stages i am also cautiously optimistic about pairing these triedandtrue staples of cancer screening with emerging methods such as liquid biopsies which can detect trace amounts of cancercell dna via a simple blood test five decades into the war on cancer it seems clear that no single cure is likely to be forthcoming rather our best hope likely lies in figuring out better ways to attack cancer on all three of these fronts prevention more targeted and effective treatments and comprehensive and accurate early detection but what causes cancer to spread we dont really know and we are unlikely to find out anytime soon because only about to percent of us cancer research funding goes to the study of metastasis our ability to detect cancer metastasis is also very poor although i do believe we are on the verge of some key breakthroughs in cancer screening right now this usually means chemotherapy contrary to popular belief killing cancer cells is actually pretty easy traditional chemotherapy occupies a fuzzy region between poison and medicine globally about to percent of all cancer cases are thought to be attributable to obesity obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers including pancreatic esophageal renal ovarian and breast cancers as well as multiple myeloma see figure type diabetes also increases the risk of certain cancers by as much as double in some cases if the first rule of cancer is dont get cancer the second rule is catch it as soon as possible alzheimers disease is perhaps the most difficult most intractable of the horsemen diseases we have a much more limited understanding of how and why it begins and how to slow or prevent it than we do with atherosclerosis while female alzheimers patients outnumber men by two to one the reverse holds true for lewy body dementia and parkinsons both of which are twice as prevalent in men yet parkinsons also appears to progress more rapidly in women than in men for reasons that are not clearfinally the author suggests how medicine needs to change it focus the first is exercise which i consider to be by far the most potent domain in terms of its impact on both lifespan and health span next is diet or nutritionor as i prefer to call it nutritional biochemistry the third domain is sleep which has gone underappreciated by medicine until relatively recently the fourth domain encompasses a set of tools and techniques to manage and improve emotional health our fifth and final domain consists of the various drugs supplements and hormones that doctors learn about in medical school and beyond,positive

outlive the science and art of longevity,risky if you take much of it literally,4,allowing common sense with supplementary googling of issues that are mentioned to be your guide there is some value in the book the author seems to endorse some unqualified views that i would not take literally if for instance you take his exercise endorsements literally you are apt to damage your joints if you consume the recommended amounts of protein for older people you may retain more lean muscle mass but you also are consuming an abundance of amino acids that promote growth and possibly the growth of cancer cellsas an example of a bizarre exercise recommendation the author endorses the view that when rucking your rucksack contents should ideally be half of your own body weight orthopedic websites say that it should not exceed of your body weight again good luck to your joints if you follow this mans advice literallythere is a sense that the author is rather too wound up he recommends taking a camera and tripod along with you to the gym and filming yourself as you exercise in order to improve he recommends doing this every day yes you actually lug a tripod and camera with you to a gym every day of your life and film yourself to improve your manner of exercisingunless you are a medical student you can safely skip over the numerous paragraphs of detailed physiological process that he describes some of the terms that he uses again much later in the book are not defined as if he assumes the reader has memorized their definitions early on his intensity evidently carries him away with such blurs of arcane informationthe last confessional chapter adds nothing to the book and if anything removes whatever credibility the author had built up to that point and i suspect that this confession was included in order to please his family as if there were no other way of doing that if i were his editor id advise him to drop it in any further printingsheres what i take from the bookthe number one influencer on longevity is exercise but if you exercise while defying orthopedic injuries tendons joints etc you wont be able to exercise at allif youre older the author endorses the view that your protein intake should be approximately double that of the traditional recommendations this double recommendation occurs on various medical websites as well if i remember thats apparently because older people process protein less efficiently and because protein helps retainbuild lean muscle mass that at least is what i remember reading but there are a number of studies that indicate that higher protein intake of animaldairy point to a higher incidence of heart disease plant protein i dont know the rate of consumption seems to be associated with a lower rate of cvd and high protein intake is not advisable if you have kidney disease and there is no evidence that higher protein intake will help repair tendons ligamentsjoints nor will collagen and then there are the growth amino acids that youre consuming in that protein that are associated with disease so the whole higher protein recommendation remains vague except for the possibility of helping to heal muscle injuries and for the elderly to retain lean muscle mass and possibly prevent fallsi look forward to the authors next volume on this subject where he will doubtless revise much of what hes said in a less intense fashion,positive
outlive the science and art of longevity,hoping the rest of the info is more accurate than ch,4,the book had lots of great info most of which was as far as i am aware scientifically valid stuff however ch which discusses stability was unfortunate it is based on numerous outdated and extremely weakly substantive thinking dns and pri have been pretty well debunked by most well informed fitness professionals there are some decent thoughts about breathing but to the ideas on patterns and development models as keys these arguments are nothing more than specious and extremely weakly supported not to mention lacking in replication this type of guru based fitness should have no foothold in a legit scientific based book its understandable however as the author seems to have had real success with these techniques however as many in fields such as pain science have noted there are a great number of ways to interphase with the sympathetic nervous system to create symptom modification and get people moving again i highly recommend checking out the works of greg lehman peter osullivan or todd hargrove he has some great books on these topics many roads to rome and often the thing that modulates symptoms is not modulating them because of the story told by the guru the outcome of the intervention does not justify the theory for why the intervention worked you dont need dns and you dont need pri you likely need loadstressor management variability and mindful movementother than that the rest of the book seems deeply thoughtful and science informed,positive
outlive the science and art of longevity,best book on health,5,favorite quote perhaps my biggest takeaway was that modern medicine does not really have a handle on when and how to treat the chronic diseases of aging that will likely kill most of ussynopsis outlive by dr peter attia is one of the best books on health and wellness ive ever read attias principle goal is to show readers that we are on a precipice continue on our path as we have in the last years and as a whole suffer more from cancer diabetes heart disease and neurodegenerative disease or move past treating symptoms once theyve arrived and focus on preventative measures to help us age without these diseasesbold premise yes accomplished also yesover the course of oo pages attia details what we face as we get older the four horsemen perhaps not the four horsemen of the apocalypse from lore but the new four horsemen of the health apocalypse as cancer rates rise so too do cases of neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimers type diabetes and other metabolic dysfunctions and heart disease the problem attia presents is that these diseases are not acute meaning that they take decades to develop while someone may have a sudden heart attack the mechanisms to create the environment that caused the heart attack have been brewing for yearsthis is where attia pushes for the move from medicine to medicine currently we are living primarily in the world of medicine treating symptoms and focusing on the present not what our health could look like in or years medicine however should begin as soon as we become aware of it or sooner medicine wants humans to avoid the four horsemen by using exercise nutritional biochemistry not diet he discusses why in the book and emotional wellbeing to set us up for living to age and beyondwhy does this book beguile written by a doctor outlive by peter attia pushes the boundaries of whats typically acceptable in medicine today he acknowledges how challenging it may be to get a dexa scan from your doctor and shares why you arent receiving proper nutritional advice from your primary provider attia hits on so many things in the medical system today that frustrate me poor tracking of health metrics treating symptoms and not causes little to no specialized nutritional advice and a pillforeverything instead of viewing a patient holisticallyuntil the medical system and more importantly the medical insurance system catches up to medicine which is probably less profitable than medicine those interested in longevity and preventative measures may live in the nebulous realm of what i call medicine medicine is where the patient like you and me must take our health into our own hands using tools like everly well and empowered dx labs you can purchase your own athome testing kits to monitor whats important to you you may have to find a more forwardthinking primary care provider to help order the right tests and scans and then take your nutrition into your own hands its quite a bit of work for the average person but well worth it to live long and enjoyable lives,positive
outlive the science and art of longevity,medicine is coming and peter attia leads the charge,5,this book is fantastic anyone with an interest in learning how to live a healthier longer life should buy a copy and study it thats what i did after reading it i ordered a second copy and gave it to my primary care physician because i wanted him to know where i was coming from in terms of being a patient and how i want to live my life outlive is a goldmine of healthcare informationi became aware of peter attia about five years ago when a friend suggested i listen to an episode of the drive for those who are unfamiliar with attia this is his weekly podcast after listening to it i was hooked and immediately became a subscriber and began listening to archived episodes i spend a lot of time commuting and to date ive probably listened to twothirds of the interviews and the ask me anything discussions so when i received the notification that his longawaited book was finally going to be published i preordered my copy once it arrived i got out my pen and highlighter and went to worki believe i can speak from a position of strength when it comes to commenting on this book i have walked a similar career path like attia ive been trained in basic science research i earned a phd under the mentorship of the great philip gollnick phd one of the pioneers of modern exercise science similar to attia ive also been trained in medicine and surgery having completed a medical degree and a surgical residency in orthopedicsattia is a voice in the wilderness shouting the message of medicine a philosophy based on the guiding principles of preventing the onset of chronic disease he defines the time from birth to the onset of chronic disease as healthspan the period of time from birth to death is lifespan the goal of medicine is to increase healthspan so that it encompasses most if not all of lifespan medicine is proactive whereas medicine where we are now is reactive medicine begins treatment of an illness or disease only after it has been diagnosed after the damage has begun medicine is based on preventing or delaying the onset of disease or illness so that treatment is avoidedhow does attia recommend we go about maximizing healthspan he believes this can be accomplished by focusing on doing everything possible to prevent what he terms the four horsemen metabolic syndrome type diabetes cardiovascular disease cancer and neurodegenerative diseases alzheimers parkinsons etc the book is broken up into sections devoted to each of the horsemen a final section where attia opens up and presents some of his personal journey is devoted to emotional health the importance of this section cannot be overstated emotional health probably should be considered the fifth horseman but that would wreck the four horsemen of the apocalypse metaphorhe focuses on ways to prevent cognitive decline the slowing of our mental processing speed as we age an emphasis is placed on exercise aerobic and strength training as an intervention exercise increases cardiovascular and respiratory function and decreases the loss of muscle size and strength it also increases bone density and deceases osteopenia and osteoporosis in short regular exercise reduces frailty as frailty increases our risk of mortality increases he makes the claim that the single most important thing anyone can do to improve healthspan is to exercise on a regular basis it is better than any drug you can take with the possible exception of rapamycin nutrient or dietattia and his coauthor bill gifford tone down the technical aspects of some of the medical topics to make it more accessible to a lay audience however this does not detract from the quality of the information if anything it makes the book better by reaching a broader audience if a reader wants more detailed information on a topic they can easily obtain it by culling through the archives of the drive where in depth interviews with preeminent physicians and scientists are available he employs a team of highly skilled analysts that are constantly reading the latest scientific publications looking for highquality research pertinent to his mission he is at the forefront of medicine if you want to learn more about your physical and emotional health with the goal of living better and longer then read outlive the science art of longevity,positive

outlive the science and art of longevity,attia does nothing halfway amazing,5,i normally dont write product reviews but after i read the few one and twostar reviews describing the book as fluff i could not control my fingers what are you kidding me to paraphrase senator lloyd bentsen i know fluff and my friends this book is no fluff rather to say that this amazing book is by far and away at the top of its genre is an understatement i write this as i embark on a second reading of outlive having read it once almost in one setting skipping a couple of exercise sessions no less attia clearly possesses the intellect integrity wit vigor candor and god knows what else that went into the making of this amazing mind and person everyone will experience the book from his special angle based on background and knowledge but no one will leave empty handed as an eye surgeon professor and author of several books myself i can say that i so thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be sharing it with my friends and family and recommending it to patients and colleagues attias content is a favorite discussion topic with my children podcast emails and finally the book and sometimes my son or daughter would wonder aloud what do you think is attias position on thisso what if i as a moslem will be adding a final chapter to the book so as to discuss it within my circle that imparts a transcendental framework to our quest for a long life beyond the raising of a strong healthy physical horse if you believe that your existence totally ends with death it makes perfect sense to embark on a quest to lengthen your life beyond which there is nothing but if you belief as i do that there is an eternal component to our essence that continues beyond the entombment of our bodies then your horizon and end point is limitless is the martyr who died defending his people and his family against oppression and tyranny at age achieving a dismal attiastyle longevity a loser a tragic figure who fell victim to unfortunate conflicts or is he worth a thousand longevityfocused horses to exclusively pamper the animal body and ignore the horseman soul is to put the cart before the horse in addition to preach that we should persevere in trying to lengthen life a few more years and spend a whole lifetime doing it strikes me as wasting your life in order to lengthen itmy advice to friends and family is this go ahead and double click on exercise and nutrition huff and buff to raise your vo max and be stable with firm resolve as you prioritize dns but do bear in mind that you are making the horse strong to serve the horseman and not the other way around we are not mere shells eat move sleep copulate repeat get yourself a more spacious framework be in control as your phosphorylated spirit commandeer the horse so that the both of you can stand marsh live and die with nobility and honor outliving to me is a transcendent term to outdo and go beyond the bounds of your biological carbonbased body to achieve escape velocity through a noble righteous life on earth that propels your soul to heaven when biology fails you so as to justify the reason that god commanded the angels to bow to adamof course this is not a book about religion and of course we agree less on religion than we do nutrition and of course moslems are a zealot punch attempt at selfdeprecating humor and of course as a physician i would love to read the page version sorry penguin random house but from my perspective this is a beautifully written book by an author that i and my kids grew to love and admire one who does not do anything halfway read it and reread it but put the material to practice by moving a good amount in between reading spurts,positive

hundred years war on palestine,the history is important to understanding today,5,the horrific hamas attack on the israelis and the planned attack on gaza by israel is best understood by looking at the history of the creation of israel and the resulting displacement and disregard of the palestinians living there this is a wellwritten and evenhanded description of that history the land possessions and rights of the palestinians were taken away by israel with the help of britain the arab states and the united states israels disregard of the lives of civilians in many instances with the help and involvement of the united states especially henry kissinger and alexander haig are as awful as the actions hamas if we believe that all people are equal and all civilians should be protected the united states has never been and is not now a neutral party that seeks peace unfortunately the term antisemitic is used against those that simply want the palestinians to have a voice a true twostate solution with an independent and free palestinian state and the recognition of israels right to exist is the only solution this book should be read by all who have grown up with a onesided view of the israeli palestinian issues,positive
hundred years war on palestine,not a page rant careful accessible scholarship to provide context,5,i was afraid of this a of bunch troll hit reviews within the last few days some disingenuous reviews claim they didnt know anything about the conflict and its somehow bad biased there will be more instead its a careful study that engages with the ideas of settler colonialism in palestine and lays out the case carefully and uses his own family history to anchor what he argueswhether you agree with the conclusions is your own choice but its a careful walk through history done well and uses his family as a frame if you want to genuinely know how the history looks from a great scholarly study from a palestinian historian and voicethis is the book you want,positive

hundred years war on palestine,a good comprehensive summary,3,this short book is rather ambitious in the sense that it sums up the history of the conflicts in israelpalestine in just over pages so inevitably khalidi left out certain details his assessment of the history of the conflict is in a way predictable as he portrays zionism as nothing but a colonial movement and he blames britain and then the us for propping up israel as if it had been a victim of persecution by the arabs there are some puzzling omissions as he does not talk much about the real motives of the arab nations in the wake of the collapse of the ottoman empire the hashemite kingdoms role in early jewish immigration cannot be ignored in this history but he does not touch this thorny issue the big surprise is the almost total omission of the yom kippur war although khalidi did experience israeli violence in lebanon personally he doesnt sound like someone in close touch with the people actually there especially in gaza that is indeed the problem of the plo or the fatah by his own admission that they were out of touch as i always got an impression that they were playing a cynical power game by deliberating placing the palestinians in harms way so that they could counter the israeli narrative of national victimhood but khalidi though admitting this problem does not explore the politics of the plo leadership deeply enough hamas needs to be examined more in detail but perhaps he is not so well informed at least this book serves as a good summary of the conflict from a palestinian perspective though personally i would like to hear the voices of those who actually live in gaza or the west bank undoubtedly the best part of the book is the final chapter in which he explains how us policy worked and how the palestinians have consistently failed to influence the us ie they were always outwitted and outsmarted by the israelis he almost sounds more like a liberal american than a palestinian his proposed course of action for the palestinian leaders are sound but also too academic which would be difficult to implement unfortunately,neutral
hundred years war on palestine,was afraid of this,2,i am someone who knew virtually nothing about the israelipalestinian conflict so i went looking for history books to help explain where it started israeli books were plentiful and did not pick one side or the other which was a tremendous help in trying to understand each sides perspective saw this book and i wasnt sure to expect there werent that many to pick from and as i suspected it was page rant by page hes criticizing all europeans and i could see regardless of his resume he couldnt be trusted as a source for new learners,negative

wheres bluey a searchandfind book,bluey fans will love,5,this keeps my kids busy for hours its like a kids version of wheres waldo there are references images for kids to try to find a match for if they are a bit older and the memorized where the images are you can describe different characters to find well worth its money,positive
wheres bluey a searchandfind book,scenes of bluey and friends,5,my daughter loves that all the characters from the show are featured throughout the book there are scenes to find a handful of images each scene is a location familiar to bluey fans but would be enjoyable for a child who hasnt seen the show as well the pages are a thicker quality so we treat this activity book like a book and keep it on the book shelf for continual use since each scene only has items to find theres no need to cross out or circle the hidden object its easy enough to keep track of what you have found and what still needs to be found this also allows the book to be shared between children or played with over and over if nothing is marked on the pages in typical bluey fun the scenes are snapshot of a moment where the characters are interacting and being silly answer key in back of book if you get stumped highly recommend,positive

hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,i have potential,5,i loved reading this book i have a disability and it has been my belief that so many people miss the great things i can bring to the table ultimately by finding the value in everyone we all get betterthe challenge i had was with the study that talked about high school students and where they would be years later struggle can happen at any point in someones life including as a sophomore or junior in high school as i read this section i caught myself wondering if those later struggles were brought into consideration i wanted to believe that you were pointing to the possibility of success later and yet missed the mark i left that section feeling like high school mattered when in reality what matters is overcoming ones own personal challenges,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,an inspiring enjoyable and worthwhile read,5,i enjoyed this book because grant stresses that we all have potential often far more than we realize too often we become frustrated when we fail to learn something new easily or when our progress seems stymied yet that is part of the natural process of learningi also like how he wrote about using your knowledge even if it is not yet perfect students learning a second language for example should be experimenting in the wild and getting corrected as much as possible when i was learning spanish in costa rica many years ago i noticed the students who spent most of their time socializing outperformed those of us who dutifully did our homework each nightin short this book is an inspiring enjoyable and worthwhile read,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,believe in you,5,dr grant has provided the reader robust research and case study outlining why we should also believe in self it isnt about your intellect its about character if we can develop good character and pro social skills there are no limits what each of us can achieve we all to often discard people because we categorize them based on race gender economic status and a whole host of other boxes to check we seldom allow individuals to show you their character and the obstacles theyve successfully navigated to get where they are today lets stop missing these opportunities and lets look for the hidden potential in all of us,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,best book yet,5,my favorite of all of adam grants booksand i didnt know that would be possible after think again so much to learn about how to bring out the best in ourselves and others i will definitely be reading this one over and over again,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,inspirational and fascinating,5,malcolm gladwell said it best this is adam grants finest work i can think of a list of people i want to give this book to a must read,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,hidden potential,5,what a great inspirational book by adam building character skills is the key to success and your hidden potential dont be afraid of discomfort,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,just started reading this bookits powerful,5,just a pleasure to readthumbs up,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,enthusiastically presented carefully structured,4,you can tell adam grant takes his work seriously and is passionate about his topic this book is an encouraging review of concepts and examples that show how success can be built from varied and difficult circumstances my only criticism is that section two creating structures to sustain motivation and momentum falls short in consideration of the various starting points beyond social and cultural circumstances that change how individuals will be positioned in better or worse ways on their journey there is a hope here to start with a level of academic rigor that few popular books attain and then build on those with reflections and interpretations that is refreshing and admirable to be sure but misses one important issue the means for ranking and rating studies and other research suffer from some of the same limitations as the selection processes he highlights in part i dont mean this to be a harsh criticism as grant shows both commitment and passion that are beyond the vast majority of authors hes very intent on making the world a better place with his work and this book embodies that recommended,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,a lot of our school system is set up one way which is to discourage failure,4,adam grant goes into why we should be celebrating when our school children make errors as they progress and grow i was not as interested in the correlation with kindergarten teachers and adult income as i was with the illustration of how many times you have to have an arrow not hit the bullseye in order to learn archery i benefited from going to montessori and engaging in selfdirected learning i love the idea of finding the perfect way to give feedback and coach for growth he has a crisp list of recommendations at the end of the book which is worth reviewing im not sure if adam grants newest book will be cited as much as carol dwecks but i know that it certainly should be,positive
hidden potential the science of achieving greater things,embrace the power of being a sponge,5,adam grant is an amazing storyteller and hidden potential is all the more captivating if you listen to the audible version with its cast of characters grants bestselling book is an empowering read that resonates with people of all backgrounds through his moving stories grant skillfully connects with readers on an emotional level allowing us to see ourselves in the experiences of others im sure i wasnt the only one to get choked up at the end of each chapterthere were so many powerful adam grant quotes woven throughout the chapters that will now become the pillars i can rely on and live by to maximize my potential from the power of being a sponge to the importance of being resilient and persevering and finding ways to manage discomfort forever adapting building scaffolding and diamonds in the rough the test of a diamond in the rough is not whether it shines from the start but how it responds to heat or pressure heat and pressure a life filled with way too much heat and pressure is likely the reason i found hidden potential to be such a profound statement about all that isnt and all that could be if we just adjusted our lenses hidden potential made me realize that so many negative extreme life struggles have a great amount of positive value after all highly recommend hidden potential the science of achieving greater things and cant help but believe that this lifealtering and potentially culturealtering read is destined for a prized award,positive
the christmas fix,heartfelt spicy christmas story,5,i just adore lucy scorethe charm of her writing the humor the endearing characters and delicious chemistry and add in christmas im a goner and i just adored this lovable story enemies to lovers forced collaboration and so much adorable banter and sexual tension cat and noah are delightful together the dialogue is witty and clever the whole fixer upper premise is loads of fun and so unique and the emotional layers just keep unravelling for a really beautiful story underneath all the fire and sass cat is a heroine you root for and noah is the character you fall for their relationship and noahs backstory had me all in my feels lucy always weaves emotional complexity so effortlessly into her stories and this one had me all up in my feelings and the spice these two are electric together the pushpull between them was epic not to mention we had a great dose of christmas running throughout if youre looking for a heartfelt tender but fun and humorous christmas romance the christmas fix is a complete delight definitely a favorite from lucy score and a top holiday read,positive
the christmas fix,sweet and spicy christmas romance,4,this book could easily be a hallmark movie i havent read mr fixer upper the first in this diet and overall it didnt make a difference although i could definitely tell at the beginning that it was not the first book on a series cat is so much fun shes a work hard like really hard occasionally play hard hgtv esque reality star and contractor set on saving the town of merrys christmas despite mr no noahs reluctance not going to lie it took a long time for me to warm up to noah he is far too judgy of cat at first but once they move past that its a sweet romance my favorite part of the whole story was that a thing the town of merry come together after a hurricane wrecked the place having lived through a hurricane flood not going to lie the beginning set off my flooding ptsd a little i really felt for the town and love getting to see cat and her crew bring the buildings back to life overall this was a sweet and spicy enemies to lovers full of christmas spirit,positive
the christmas fix,christmas story with a twist,4,this book is a bit of a departure for the author usually she features a macho takecharge bossy guy and an insecure but smart woman in this case the heroine is the smart outspoken one she is pitted against a sweet gentle man i really liked thishowever once they get together the author goes back to her usual takecharge bossy guy and i didnt like him as wellthe book is wellwritten and it was also a christmasthemed story im a sucker for a christmas booki just wish the male could have remained sweet and tender throughout,positive

the christmas fix,the mamma jamma of all christmas romances cat king is amazing,5,if youve read mr fixer upper and if you havent what on earth are you waiting for you probably already love cat king i know i did as soon as i finished mr fixer upper i had a list of characters i was hoping for more from cat was at the top she was so full of life she worked hard and played just as hard she stood up for what she believed in she was a great friend and loved her family dearly how much more could you ask for in a character i loved cat kingso lucy score is fantastic she heard the outcry of her fans and the whispers okay its catthey were probably shouts from cat and the christmas fix was born okay im not positive exactly how this happened but this is how i like to imagine it either way lucy gave us the christmas fix an amazing enemiestolovers christmas story and it is perfect i thought i loved cat king before but now i am completely enamored i am in awe of this woman everything i liked about her before is magnified by a million but there is also this other side to her that we didnt get to see in mr fixer upper this side that loves so hard cares so deeply and turns to mush only at the most perfect of moments she is a complete and total rockstar she still stands up for womens rights works herself harder than anyone else and enjoys having a good time but watching her fall in love is truly something specialand noah oh noah noah may seem like a complete jerk in the beginning remember this is enemiestolovers and i already loved cat but there is just something about him he is so noble even when he is completely wrong he has good intentions he is a good sensible guy who loves his daughter and his town he wants to protect both from anything that could harm them unfortunately he believes cat king falls into that category however cat being cat is determined to prove him wrong as the story unfolds you fall further and further in love with noahi absolutely love these two together the balance they found with one another was incredible noah needs cat to bring him out of his shell and really live he needs her to show him what fun really is and noah is the stability and steadfast support cat needs in her crazy life and the chemistry oh my goodness the chemistry these two are completely off the charts their banter is fantastic cat says what she thinks and doesnt hold back which causes andor ends some fantastic arguments and their love is even more explosive than their hate while you have to wait for them to get there it is completely worth it the tension builds until it boils over in perfectionwhat more could you want right well in true lucy score fashion this book brings all the feels the town of merry really becomes a character of its own with the wonderful people and traditions it holds dear watching the town come together in this time of need is amazing the residents are unique and wonderful the way they support one another is heartwarming the way they take in cat and her crew is extraordinary i seriously want to move therewho wouldntthis book was beautifully written the symbolism is subtle and truly amazing the characters are so real and complex and seriously all the feels are there without it being over the top there are very few authors that can include humor love witty banter and so much emotion in the same book naturally but this book truly has it all i cant recommend it enoughwhat are you still doing here put your time to good use and one click now this is a book you dont want to miss,positive
the christmas fix,you did it again,5,such a great story lucy you do such an awesome job of keeping it real and believable i read for escape from the craziness of this world noah and cat definitely gave me that write faster lucyive read almost all of your books,positive
the christmas fix,favorite christmas book i reread every year,5,i love this book i read this book every year around the holidays lucy score is one of the few authors i read that writes mostly in third person i prefer reading first person dual point of view but the way lucy writes it doesnt bother me the story is so good and so well written that i dont struggle to follow our feel confusednoah is the manager of the small town of merry connecticut a town that was destroyed after a a bad storm leaving property damage by wind and rain hes up tight needs to be in control of everything in his life and has earned the nickname mr no cat is general contractor who stars in a home makeover tv show she had done a home in merry so when the town was hit by that devastating storm she felt the need to go back and help in any way she could that led to her coming up with an idea to restore as much of the town as possible while filming it for the show this way the town could get the help it needed and her show would also benefit in paid advertising and ratings noah was not receptive to this and fought her every step of the way they butted heads until their arguing led to a heated make out session soon they were sneaking around together and learning that they both had the same agenda for the town what started as hate turned into lust and eventually turned into love knowing that noah could never leave his home as he was coparenting cat has to decide if she can figure out a way to be with noah and possibly give up her lifestyle of moving around the country rehabbing homesthis is such a great story and i absolutely love noah and cat they are both such strong capable people so different but so right for each other this is a funny and steamy love story and as i mentioned above i love it so much that i reread it every year highly recommendbookstagrambrielle,positive

elon musk,if you want to grow an elon musk personality skip standard life advice,5,one of the conclusions i reached early in my life is that there is a huge disconnect between so called conventional wisdom in most important areas of life and what actually works in real life as shown for example in the difference between being an alist celebrity and ranking high in the forbes list of wealthiest individualselon musks life that walter isaacson documents in this book is a prime example of this disconnectif you go by standard advice about what it takes to get admitted into one of americas top schools there is no way that in a white kid without connections who grew up in a somehow privileged background upper middle class in segregated south africa who scores v q in the sat in his second try would be offered admission at any of americas top universities and yet this what elon musk looked like on paper circa when he applied as transfer student to the university of pennsylvania luckily for the united states admission committees at americas top schools years ago were more rational than their contemporary counterparts elon musk gained admission to the university of pennsylvania and the rest as they say is historymy path crossed with elon musks at the stanford seminar mentioned at the beginning of chapter of the book back then i was a nervous young professional who had just submitted his application for graduate study at stanford praying that i would get in i recall two things distinctively from that talk elons telling that he had dropped out of stanford to start his first company i told myself that i would not be as silly if i got in that he told the audience during the qa that he didnt think a particular degree or life experience prepared someone better than others to become a successful entrepreneur both ideas went against the standard advice i had heard from other speakers at the entrepreneurial thought leaders seminar and unimpressed i didnt go to say hello to elon musk at the end of the talk in the book i learn that its in that seminar that jeffrey straubel approached elon for an investment in teslai have gone back many times in my mind to that october talk since elon musk began to be recognized for his genius in silicon valley circles late s early sit is often said that a persons character is forged during a persons childhood and teen years the biggest insight i am getting from walter isaacsons book is that elon musks were the exact opposite of what experts in child and teen development say what those years should be likei get that elon musk is a controversial personality with some at the same time the western civilization needs more people like him if it wants to continue to be the leading civilization in the world both on the technological front as well as on the population front his ideas on low birthrates being the biggest threat to civilization are right on the moneyto summarize i cannot recommend this book highly enoughi want thank both elon musk as well as walter isaacson for partnering to make it a reality its very rare in human history to have a chance to get such a detailed insight into the mind of one of the contemporary history making personalities,positive
elon musk,rocket man,5,every aerospace executive and board member should read walter isaacsons biography of elon musk starting from scratch musk has built americas leading rocket and space communications company by ignoring the hidebound bureaucratic rules of the major aerospace companies delivering rockets at one tenth the cost of his bloated competitors musks rules are doubt every requirement question every cost act with a sense of urgency learn by failing improvisethe other secret that musk applied to tesla as well as spacex is that he integrated design engineering and manufacturing so that each of those entities can learn from the others thus engineers and designers are able to make improvements in manufacturing as issues arise steve jobs at apple integrated design and engineering but outsourced manufacturing to chinarising from an unhappy childhood in south africa musk became a silicon valley entrepreneur to become part of the famed paypal mafia he used his paypal success to fund tesla and spacex and the rest is historymusks genius has the ability to inspire loyalty at least for a time of a host brilliant people who built his empire however empathy is not his middle name and in many ways he seems to be a very cruel person he is one of those people who professes to love humanity but really doesnt like people as individualsisaacson discusses musks chaotic personal life three marriages children two of whom by sperm donation isaacson doesnt explain why so many of musks children were conceived by in vitro fertilizationthen of course there is twitter now called x after his favorite letter his adventure at twitter seems to be one giant ego trip where he promised to free that social media site from it wokeness to say the staff of twitter was woke would be an understatement he wanted to encourage free expression yet under his rule twitter has become a cesspool of hatei had my own run in with twitter despite all of musks talk of a new openness i was banned for using the term circular firing squad to characterize hunter biden bringing his father into his legal thicket something is really wrong with x and from press accounts is seems to be getting worse by the daydespite being hagiographic at times isaacson brings to life one of our leading entrepreneurs who is bringing us into new electric and space ages,positive
elon musk,isaacsons best a tour de force on three dimensions,5,this book is very likely isaacsons best one he got almost unlimited access to elon and team for two years two elon three a fascinating case of embracing riskwithcapitalr as not something to avoid do no harm not something to optimize riskreward analysis but something to warmly embrace and overcome with will surge and firstprinciple driven engineeringthe book has essentially three broad parallel themes often intertwined in narratives relationship family and friends relationship and evolution of it with elons parents grandparents of both sides kids spousessos siblings especially kimbal cousins and a handful of business friends including some employees in both tesla and spacexresults zippaypal evs solarroof rocketsnasa neuralink hyperloop twitter workspaces where elon ventured and revolutionized themregulating principles this is where isaacson has done a masterful job he observed probed and eked out a set of rules that elon follows with himself with how he gets work done with other peopleas someone whos worked hardcorely if i may in tesla during famed production hell and was lucky to witness several of the events mentioned eg th car of the week a black model coming out of factory on june at amish isaacsons description of tesla and its missiondriven culture is accurate though as a genuine believer in that mission seemed awfully short some of elons brilliant management emails deserved a mention eg how notto communicate no abbreviations hierarchy agnostic how tonot meet get out if you are adding no value how to set goals hofstadders law set it so ambitious that even missing it by would still get it done twice as fast had it not been set so etc plus elon is always highly readable and shortto bridge to standard practices of management as it is followed in most western world today the author follows up with most people after they had interesting pushbacks from elon mostly when they either did not have an answer and did not say they did not know or when simply elon was thinking far ahead of them and thinking multithreaded to not offer much of contextual relevance the emphasis on small teams with right individuals will always outcompete large teams is spot on and is essentially why autopilot is successful with engineers and twitter was awfully slow moving with few thousandslast third of the book was often observed and written in first person the author was present in many of those events but that takes a little bit away from the velocity of the book and perhaps adds more pages that merely repeat the themes already established with apt narratives earlier in the book moving twitters servers from sacramento data center to portland first thought to take months till elon diverted his jet landed in sacramento opened an air vent with a borrowed utility knife went underneath the rack and essentially did a poc is one such example it was an intersting read especially for an engineer irrespectiveno single individual in last years perhaps did change things more for humanity as a macro elon musk is the best way to understand him and is a brilliant captivating read the grand theme of the book to me was as elon was quoted this is how civilizations decline they quit taking risks and when they quit taking risks their arteries harden every year there are more referees and fewer doersthis is not just a book on elon musk this is a book to look at risk with a fundamentally different world or should i say cosmic view,positive
elon musk,an expedition into the genius of elon musk a review of walter isaacsons portrayal,5,walter isaacsons narrative on elon musk is nothing short of a masterful voyage through the labyrinth of one of the most iconic innovators of our age the book is a meticulously crafted narrative weaving the intricacies of musks remarkable journey with a depth that leaves the reader both inspired and enlightened its a comprehensive expedition into the life and mind of elon musk em displaying an exquisite balance of aweinspiring moments coupled with a grounded critique that keeps the narrative tethered to a realm of practicalitythe section that notably stands out is the exploration into ems management mantras the unraveling of the algorithm a term synonymous with musks methodical approach towards problemsolving and the traits he values in his team excellence trust and discipline are not merely discussed but dissected this portion of the book is a well of insights for anyone eager to decode the enigmatic leadership style of emisaacson with his seasoned narrative prowess doesnt merely tell a story he takes you on an intellectual expedition unveiling layers of ems persona and managerial acumen the critique embedded within the narrative ensures the reader doesnt get lost in the glorification but stays grounded appreciating the practical implications and the tangible takeaways from musks journeya unique charm of isaacsons writing is his ability to delve deep into the subject while maintaining a broader perspective the wish for his next venture to contrast the geniuses hes chronicled is palpable one can only anticipate the richness such a narrative would entail juxtaposing the different shades of brilliance that have shaped the modern technological epochin conclusion this book isnt just a biography its a meticulously crafted lens through which one can appreciate the genius of elon musk rendered with a level of finesse and understanding that is quintessentially isaacson its not just a read but an experience that leaves you with a profound understanding and a lingering curiosity for the boundless realm of innovation,positive
elon musk,a great man of history,5,this is a fascinating biography that tells the warts and all story of one of the greatest men of the st century elon musk has emerged from a toxic and abusive childhood to becoming the richest man on the planet having revolutionized space travel and reinvented the electric car the book tells in detail about how he did those things as well as delving into robotics ai neural implants to cure blindness and paralysis and other thingsthe book also notes that musk is far from a nice guy lacking the ability to feel empathy and having a tendency to fly into rages as well as deep depression the book does not exactly put its subject on the couch but it does give an insight into what drives himmusk personifies the great man theory of history the theory suggests that history is driven by great men almost always men who rise to power seemingly out of nowhere and drive people and nations to achieve great things just imagine what our world would be like without musk and one must conclude that for all of his quirks and flaws the world is lucky to have him in it,positive
elon musk,approach this book fearlessly,5,this is a brilliant attempt by walter isaacson to delve into what makes up this centurys genius elon musk not an easy book about a one of a kind human being elon musk has gone and will go where no one else has so far he is a contradiction on virtually every level difficult to like but impossible not to respect hence the top people in technology eagerly work for and with him he says what he believes and cares not at all for the repercussions because it is his truth his predictions for the future of the earth and mankind are impossible to ignore and the liars despise him for itfor his part isaacson has captured this controversial genius as succinctly as he did steve jobs i finished this book as an elon musk fan and think others will alsoread this book to learn about americas possibilities going forward not to learn how to be a billionaire,positive
elon musk,as complex as the man himself but well told for the rest of us,5,i dont think there is much doubt about elon musk being a genius and genius rarely fit well in the world the rest of us inhabit their thinking and drives simply dont work in a system based on getting along and establishing your place a genius is constantly a square peg in a round hole that is almost the definition of the termhowever we all want a look inside the mind of a genius walter isaacson is the rare writer who can present a complex person in such a way that we want to read each and every word by the end of the book we are both excited about what musk can do and totally exhausted by the effort he requires of those around himi venture to say none of us will agree with everything he doessays and we shouldnt worry about that he will try anything and is willing to fail spectacularly it is the only way he sees to get big things done while i certainly agree with him about this i wouldnt want to trade places walter isaacson is able to get the reader to see all this,positive
elon musk,most interesting book i have ever read,5,the book is a very long and detailed book but the most fascinating book i have ever read i had a negative impression of elon musk and was curious why he was always in the news i thought he got lucky with his successes but he is nothing like i imagined he is a completely unique brilliant compulsive and driven human being he is a slave driver with his employees but he is right there working with them everything he accomplished which is beyond anything i knew about is incredible there is so much about this world i know nothing about and at will never know walter isaacson did an excellent job with this book,positive
elon musk,illuminating story behind the entrepreneur and his endeavors,5,if you follow musks companies like tesla spacex you will probably find this biography of the man behind them to be very illuminating musks companies are an extension of musk himself and his ideals the book explains a lot and i recommend itit was a sometimes uncomfortable read for me because i have known extremely intelligent people with similar personality traits to musk due to my schooling and career i dont enjoy dealing with themthe author is to be commended for his reasonably balanced handling of any political issues that ariseof course the musk life saga continues after reading this book you may like me ponder what is going to happen to musks companies as he approaches his expiration date,positive
elon musk,one word inspiring,5,the author did an amazing job or capturing the ins and outs of one of if not the greatest innovators of our time it is amazing to see what one can do when they have the backing of billions of dollars i am not taking anything away from the pure genius of elon musk just commenting on something that is not addressed in the book which is that he created instant adulthood financial success and was as genius about reinvesting it in humanity focused endeavors as he is genius about building and scaling technology i loved every minute of this book and found myself becoming more inspired each day,positive
the complete cookbook for young chefs recipes that youll love to cook and eat,mostly good info for kids of all ages with reservations as noted,4,basic recipes with good directions and photos id have loved to have had this helpful info when i was young and trying to learn to cook by myself it was always a joy to surprise my mom with food on the table when she got home from work even when just a grilled cheese sandwich made in an old pie pan under the broiler and a can of soup id opened and heated on the stove the possibilities available in this book are a great beginning to open the imaginations of curious kids to tastes textures and the many rewards and confidence boost of good cookingmy only negative comment is the use of food processors and similar newer tools when a large bowl a spoon or spatula and some elbow grease worked fine as food processors for centuriesinsert eye roll here also describing to the kids how to to separate an egg using your bare hands was a completely new and approaching barbaric idea i had never heard of or even thought of doing ick when there are always two halves of eggshells to use from one to the other why would anyone pour the raw egg in their hand to let all but the yolk then dribble through their fingers aside from the convenient shells already in your hands theres also an easy kitchen tool called an egg separater yes really that could have been shown among the kitchen tools much easier less gross and all around cleaner otherwise this book and the baking book for kids are mostly recommended except they both provide these same glaringly bogus instructions for unsuspecting children hmmm maybe that was the point,positive

tom lake a reeses book club pick,a buddhist blend of grovers corners and northern michigan,5,appreciating the little things in life the joy of daytoday existence and the love for your family and your work is what tom lake meant to me tom lake refers to a fictional summer stock theater in northern michigan in the s close to the locale of the current timeline a cherry farm and pears and apples the late eighties marked a luminous period for protagonistnarrator lara a time that she walked the fine line between adulting and adulthood coming of age amid a torrent of drama that swept her up in its fury and then there was our town the play within the novel that portrayed laras life on the stage and backstagelara is telling her three twentysomething daughters about her short stint as an actress in her twenties and the brief romantic affair with peter duke a famous movie star before he was a famous movie star the gorgeous cherry farm backdrop is like a staid but vivid character with lara husband joe and the three girls all together for the first time in a while due to the pandemic they dont have the usual crew to help pick the fruit so the storytelling unfolds as the family works the orchard during harvest time like the cherries some parts are sweet some tart and all of it is juicyi felt the air inhaled the scents the cherries the land and the whole layout of the farm while reading and there is the kindness too of this family whose flaws are also part of their strengths the chaos of laras life as a young woman is juxtaposed with the serenity of her life now and the two timelines fluidly alternate sometimes gently at other times with piercing intensity and every storyline has at least two so when you read about lara in the past or present you just cant help sniffing around to see the connections of what surprise is crouched in the corner or hidden behind the door i verily slipped into laras character and imagined what decisions i would make as her given so many pressing options and dilemmasann patchett nails it every time her characters are complex and her graceful pace is measured even when events are brutal lara is a radiant workinprogress during her young years many readers will see themselves in her i was a local stage actor in austin during my twenties so i immersed myself in tom lake pretending to be lara acting as emily gibbs and then back to lara again the two timelines showed the difference between the fiery summer love of youth and the deep tender and mature love of family that you helped to create the high points were explosive even when they were pindrop quiet laras low points stirred me almost to tears i could feel her pulse against mineif youve never seen a production or havent read our town youre about to get a spoilers worth in the novel but i think ms patchett has surmised that most of her readers are already familiar with thornton wilders play she coalesced our town and tom lake together in a way that reveals her refined skill of integration tom lake and our town were separate but conjoined i know that doesnt make sense but it will when you read the book she also quotes chekhov at pique and even peak intervals she shares the russian writers work with spare but specific devotioni recently learned that patchett has never owned a smart phone and doesnt herself do social media she talks to the camera and her staff completes the rest she has never used google or researched on wikishe does it the oldfashioned way and perhaps shes that slightly eccentric but lovely gentlewoman you see carrying paper road mapstom lake is thoughtful deft and lifeaffirming it isnt a pandemic novel even though it takes place during that time theres comedy tragedy dramaa lookbackatyour ownlife kind of book its classic ann patchetttheres this passage that really tickled me from the book its toward the end but not a spoiler its thematic with the rest of the narrative lara was so busy recounting the past for her daughters that she forgot to make lunch which she said she should have been working on while talking the past need not be so allencompassing that it renders us incapable of making egg salad priorities,positive
tom lake a reeses book club pick,thornton wilder redux,4,i certainly loved bel canto and as a result i was eager to read tom lake based on the glowing reviews however after pages then pages then i was willing to close it and put in the little library box or pass it on to a neighbor it just seemed so done before the story was obvious and the characters were all meh everything seemed like it had been hashed over a million times a million times betterbut i kept reading because the neighbor i would have given it to had left for vacation i figured id plod through actually if i werent so willing to close it and pick up another book it would have been a quick read until the neighbor came home so of course i read on mid way through i was invested but still willing to close it and move on three quarters through the characters became more human and interesting and then i realized that the author wasnt reinventing the wheel but reinterpreting our town duh she said after being hit over the head with the sledge hammer of metaphor of the plot and on the last page i was cryingso i do recommend this book,positive
tom lake a reeses book club pick,a book to savor and reflect on,5,ann patchett is one of my favorite writers and she has once again written a novel i lovethe novel takes place at the beginning of the covid epidemic lara her husband and her three young adult daughters are residing on the family orchard in northern michigan the narrative is told from laras viewpoint and consists primarily of her daughters wanting to know about her past life especially her romantic involvement with the now famous actor peter dukemuch of the story is about a summer stock stage production of our town located in michigan on tom lake lara is in her twenties and has been called upon to take the lead role after the original actress has decided to quit on laras first day she is greeted by a charismatic young man named peter duke from their first meeting evolves a drawnout romance and affair that leaves lara much beholden to peters narcissistic view of himself lara is quite aware that her daughters want to know all the intimacies that she and peter shared but she is not ready to give out these details freelyit is understood that lara once had a promising future in acting but she chose to give it up for what she considers her idyllic life as a mother and wife her daughters find this all hard to absorb and want to know every last bit about lauras time with peter and her involvement with the stagethe writing flows beautifully and the imagery is incandescent i could see lara and feel her emotions ann patchett knows people and her empathic writing exudes from every page there isnt one false notei have never read our town but that didnt stop me from loving this novel nor did it prevent me from understanding what was transpiring i learned a lot about stage production acting and actorsi especially loved how the author provided each of her daughters with a distinct and inimitable personality all beloved to her and each other this is a book to savor and reflect on it is as sweet as the smell of cherries in laras michigan orchard,positive
tom lake a reeses book club pick,the play our town revisited,4,ann patchett is a gifted writer and once again her unique ability to create characters within an engaging plot is well developed the story revolves around tom lake a community summer theatre production in michigan patchett weaves a story told from the main character who aspires to be an actress but is conflicted with the reality of the demands within the acting profession a side story includes the quaint setting of a cherry fruit farm and patchett describes the scenery of the farm and daily life with flawless description the novel is connected to the famous play our town since i had not read the play for many many years i was a little lost in the beginning rereading our town in advance might bring familiarity to the reader i recommend the story one of early romance missed opportunities and chosen paths,positive
tom lake a reeses book club pick,a sleeper hit,5,this book grew on me it started out slow and i wasnt so engaged with the characters at first but i found myself checking in on them often and by the end of the book i loved them all what initially had me not excited about the book became one of its highlights its about real people who are all familiar and very human life and how things happen and relationships and experiences and how they define us so very relatable and now i too want to live on a cherry orchard in michigan or at least visit one,positive
tom lake a reeses book club pick,read them all,4,i love all of ann patchetts books they are all different and all interesting i listened to this one narrated by meryl streep and read it on the kindle app trying to finish it before a book club meeting and i loved hearing streep read patchetts lovely words is it my favorite of her books no but its still worth reading,positive
tom lake a reeses book club pick,a fabulous story from one of americas great novelists,5,i love ann patchett whose gifts as a storyteller are almost unmatched as wideranging as her varying choice of subjects tom lake is another triumph and not just because it centers around folks in the theatre although im sure that helpedlara kenison played emily webb in her high school production of our town as have so many young girls have in their past but for lara it becomes a touchstone in her life in college she reprises the role and a famous hollywood agent happens to see her performance the tinseltown legend suddenly becomes real flying to la screen tests her first film role commercials even a tv series then while waiting for the films longdelayed release she goes off to summer stock at tom lake in wisconsin there she meets her first great love a fire of ambition named peter dukeyears later lara unspools the story of her hollywood adventure to her nowgrown daughters including some discrete details of her love affair with duke now a huge movie star lara and her husband joe run a fruit farm in rural michigan the story of how she goes from the la dream factory to the cherry orchard unfolds while she and her daughters pick the ripening fruit in the hot summer sunthere are twists and turns in every story and laras journey from ingenue to farm wife has some hairpin turns that the reader will likely never see coming its patchetts great skill as a story master that keeps us as engaged as her daughters hearing the tale unspool while the three sisters yes in a cherry orchard demand to know more we are as eager as they to learn laras tale of adventures on stage and offi tore through this book in a few days despite a busy endofsummer schedule thank heavens for a day off to finish it it immediately ranks with my favorite of patchetts worksa great read,positive

the covenant of water oprahs book club,long and dense but ultimately a beautiful tour de force,5,phew i made it finished complete finat pages the covenant of water is a commitment its long its dense its heartbreaking more often than its not and with every new character introduced i found myself wondering where it was going and how it might end but its also beautifully rendered meticulously researched and a tour de force given that i have no idea how i should rate it against everything else ive read this yearthe novel spans almost years and takes place primarily in southern india the story opens in with the arranged wedding of a yearold girl to a much older man following their strained and awkward nuptials he brings her to his home called parambil around which a community has developed as she begins to learn how to be a wife to her husband and the awkwardness between them begins to thaw as she grows older she also comes to learn of her husbands genealogy and the repeated tragedy that afflicted many of his ancestors the girl who by now has become a young woman and is known as big ammachi comes to refer to it as the condition whereby an unnatural number of ancestors in her husbands lineage have had an aversion to water and several have died in what would typically be avoidable circumstances involving waterwhile the condition crops up as a through line over the course the novel the book is less about that mysterious affliction than it is a multigenerational character study of a family and the people who move in their circles the novel flows like a river with detailed scenes and character development intertwining the reader meanwhile is left to be carried along like an oarless boat upon that river i will admit that i got frustrated at times with the book even by the halfway point it felt like plenty of story had been told and it was time to wrap things up yet nearly additional pages still awaited me what more needs to be told how will this end when will it endthere is a passage in the book in which verghese writes the followingand now she is here standing in the water that connects them all in time and space and always has the water she first stepped in minutes ago is long gone and yet it is here past and present and future inexorably coupled like time made incarnate this is the covenant of water that theyre all linked by their acts of commission and omission and no one stands aloneshame on me for doubting verghese or his intentions and for presuming these seemingly disconnected pieces wouldnt eventually find one another to complete the puzzle while i was being carried along the river verghese was weaving a complex tapestry around me every character and story in the meandering novel has a purpose and all of that intention is pulled together and made clear in the final or so pages verghese honors the passage above and like the water he references he beautifully ties together the strands of his storyits been more than a decade since i read cutting for stone and i remember it fondly although the details are admittedly hazy acknowledging the hazy memory could be off a bit i still feel that the covenant of water represents verghese taking his skills to another level there is plenty of medicine in the book like in cutting for stone but more broadly than in that work with verghese tackling several diseases that have since been mostly eradicated with leprosy leading the way verghese also uses almost years of indian history and the birth of the nation as a backdrop starting with the british occupation and class and caste systems that evolved around that through indian independence and the battle between socialism and a more marketdriven economy that followed the role of women in indian society is a consistently and critically examined theme as such in many ways the covenant of water is an ode to the strength and contributions of women particularly in a more maledominated society and cultureso how do i rate this beast of a work which was undeniably brilliant and complex but also struggled to retain my interest at times for starters it is the book for which i have the most respect among those ive read this year i didnt enjoy it the most and i wouldnt universally recommend it as i said at the top its a commitment but when i consider the amount of time and research and intricate plotting and effort that went into this and then compare that to some of the more enjoyable but less expansive books among this years favorites i have to acknowledge the authors accomplishment while i didnt love every moment reading the book and i found myself breaking it up and reading other things in between i did really enjoy it if i look back on it in its entirety if it had fizzled to a conclusion that wouldnt be the case but i think the final two sections of the book pull everything together in a wonderful way that made me appreciate the purposeful intention of all that came beforefor those of us that read regularly im sure weve all thought to ourselves at some point i bet i could write a pretty good novel i have certainly read books good books and come away still believing or even being inspired that i might be able to create something comparable the covenant of water is in a different league and for anyone harboring aspirations of authorship it will humble you and remind you that there are many levels to writing and there are certain levels that are simply unobtainable for all but a few its the type of book that illustrates an author operating at the apex of his craft where all of his skills around writing planning dialogue structure and research come together to create something beautiful go in with eyes wide open this will probably dominate your nightstand for several weeks but trust that the payoff at the end is worth the journey to get there,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,a monumental and original family saga that packs an emotional wallop,5,this is a monumental and original family saga that is like nothing i have ever read it is richly imaginative and packs an emotional walloptaking place in kerala a state in south india on the malabar coast it spans nearly years and is brutally realistic this isnt a sweetsielovey story its about life real life and it hurts the reader sometimes children die loved ones die by suicide people are killed in somewhat brutal and violent ways and several suffer debilitating injuries its a tough read because i was emotionally connected with the characters and then wham they die or suffer but that is the ultimate premise of this book finding the meaning in sufferingmagnificently written by physician and bestselling author abraham verghese this epic multigenerational novel begins in and ends in centering on the character of big ammachi she is years old when her father dies leaving her mother destitute in a desperate move this little girl is hurriedly married off to a yearold widower and father of a yearold boy who lives kerala a long days journey away she is nicknamed big ammachi big mother by jojo the little boy and the name sticks as she grows up to become the matriarch of a large family living on the acre estate of parambil as she soon discovers this family has a curse the condition as they call it that takes the life of someone every generationin addition there are parallel stories that at first are seemingly unrelated the most intriguing one is that of digby kilgour a surgeon from glasgow scotland who joins the indian medical service in madras his is also a story of joy and tragedy that eventuallysurprisingly and explosivelyconnects with the family in parambil although it is a long and circuitous journey to that endin addition to a compelling everevolving and multilayered plot inhabited by bold and vivid characters this is a profound work of literature that speaks eloquently and poignantly about one familys place on earthhow they love how they argue how they do good how they do evil how they worship god and how they make the world a better place by just inhabiting it as you can probably tell from the title the imagery and symbolism of water and specifically how the covenant of water links all human beings is brilliantthis is also a love letter to medicineto dedicated physicians to the scientists who make the medical discoveries to the hardworking nurses and especially to all those who give their life to care for the sickbonus even though its told only in words youll get a tour of south india that is so vibrant and so realistic that when i googled photos of the area it appeared very much like it did in my imagination the land is so much a part of the novel that it is almost a character of its own this is truly a magical place with beautiful beaches elaborate canals and picturesque mountains filled with monkeys elephants snakes birds and tigerstwo pieces of advice to make reading this page book easier there are dozens of characters in this novel and even the kindle xray feature is not that helpful go to the authors website and download the character list print it if youre reading the paper version of the book if youre reading it on kindle i advise you to use the send to kindle feature i had this document right next to the book so it was easy to search for or find the character it doesnt take long before youll know who everyone is there are quite a few words in the novel in malayalam the official language of kerala in most cases its easy to figure out the meaning based on the context of the sentence but i kept my phone nearby so i could google words i couldnt decipher,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,two verghese books in a week i must be nuts,5,i never write book reviews until now my house is a wreck let me explain i just read two abraham verghese books back to back in a week if you know that author you understand why ive accomplished little elsei just finished his latest his magnum opus the covenant of water i had a lovehate relationship with this grand novel the pages required a big commitment but since i am a voracious reader that wasnt a problem the love part was because of vergheses outstanding writing his characters and settings practically jump off the pages and thanks to the authors everyday occupation as a physician i now know more about anatomy than i need or want to know the writing evokes a curiosity that leads to googling maps of india and researching indian dissident groups and even looking up the bones of the body at one point i was ready to book a flight to india this was getting dangerousthe hate part relates to the same thing you fall in love with one character and the author moves on to another seemingly unrelated one wait you cry dont stop there well be patient dear reader all is not lost or even what it seemsthe story is one of things lost and found of overcoming suffering and moving on with life themes most of us can relate to in some way the shifts in time and place and characters caused some confusion especially when i was listening to the audiobook this is a book you need to read i mean really read and pay attention it is not an easy read more than once i found myself wondering what the heck that has to do with where this is going but true to form verghese wraps it up neatly in the last pages he does go around robin hoods barn to get there but in the end it is a very satisfying conclusion one that earns it on my book list and one of my top five for the year his previous novel cutting for stone tops my list for the year this one was close for that honor and it was worth the journey,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,stunning,5,this is a powerful epic novel exquisitely written and the characters are engaging at times mysterious and unforgettable the author weaves seemingly disparate plot lines that keep the reader wondering about how these story lines could possibly come together it all comes together in the end beautifully and hauntinglyive seen some reviews proclaiming this to be a faithbased story which it certainly is not that impression may have arisen in that one of the central characters is spiritual and happens to be a follower of christianity in a nonwestern society ive seen some reviews claiming it is boring which i find inexplicable but realize it may be a challenging read and not for everyone bottom line is this is a complex thoughtprovoking masterpiece and unforgettable i highly recommend it,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,a masterpience,5,abraham verghese is the michelangelo of writers i was caught up from the beginning and captivated by the entire story what made the difference for me was also listening to him read no perform the book his accent word pronunciations and expression were so much better than the voice in my head i usually prefer to read rather than listen but once i heard him perform i couldnt go back i even followed along in the book so i could see the words he was reading this is the best book ive ever readlistened to and there are not enough superlatives to properly honor it,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,beautiful book,5,i was initially struck by the authors ability to describe miserable situations and unappealing human traits with such neutrality no judgment or apologies and then i was pulled fully into this book this story this epic and stopped judging it myself instead i fell into the beautiful rich tragic world verghese creates the backdrop of the indian countryside and the swirling political climate were backburner issues that almost became their own characters as they enriched and contextualized the sagai loved this book and was sad for it to end halfway through it i bought another of his books,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,incredible story,5,this is a very long book and it took me a long time to read it sometimes i left it aside for days because it had not grabbed me the two stories seemed disjointed and didnt make much sense in the same book however i continued because it was so beautifully written at the astonishing end everything comes together and becomes cleari am incredibly impressed by the authors wealth of knowledge and how well he shares it through his writing his list of quotes is incredible i learned very much and this book will always remain in my memory,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,pages wasnt enough,5,this was a great generational saga that i wished to have another pages to read it is hard to review such an astounding work of art as you get into the story a year old bride embarks on her journey to her new much older husband in the husbands family there is some sort of mysterious curse that causes someone from each generation to die by wateras the story develops you will become totally immersed in the people and their cultures and customs their histories and politics i was thoroughly engrossed and kept reading until my kindle ran out of gas for a better synopsis find the new yorker magazines book recommendations i also recommend reading cutting for stone by this same author,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,brilliant storytelling,5,loved the book despite the numerous tragedies that befell the characters there were moments of great humor and profound joy the story was so compelling it was hard not to ignore work and other obligations to just read straight throughoccasionally the medical details feel a little excessive but since many tie into the story on balance they do add colorhope to visit kerala one day soon,positive
the covenant of water oprahs book club,an absorbing gem,5,the intersection between members of several families especially in this rigid rulebound society is fascinating to see even as it evolves and changes the impact of the covenant of water on many of the characters in the novel helps to hold together this sprawling story i admit that i lost track of the names and relationships i of some of the characters but by the end i had sorted out who was who,positive

haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,the wattpad and ao girlies get it,4,if you ever had a wattpad account this is for you my friend a stalker who runs a secret organization to stop human trafficking and wants to lowkey overthrow the government who also happens to have mismatched eyes and scars sounds like every mafia mc love interest to mehowever this one actually hits i devoured this book its intense hot very illegal and problematic but i would be lying if i said i didnt enjoy almost every second of it it was a guilty pleasure read thank god no one else reads my book because the horror of picking that book up without any warning and im so glad that its fictionits greatuntil the last two chapters i understand wanting a cliffhanger but wtf no villain reveal what a load of bs also this would be the root of my main issue with book two there were no crumbs no hints nothing toward the villains identity i understand that there was a specific reason for this wanting to keep the person overlooked but you cant have a villain revealmystery without having enough clues to make the reader guess it thats mystery you have to reward the reader and the ending just laughs in the readers face in that department,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,help ive fallen in love with a stalker,5,theres a reason i dont read incomplete duets or series because then im sad when i cant read the next book i went against my better judgment with this book and i have no regrets okay i have some because i hated waiting for book two because i loved this story the great news is the second book is out now so you dont have to wait if youre reading this reviewive never read anything remotely similar to this book and i dont know that i ever will this was my first time reading something truly as dark as this ive read other books with heavy triggers but this book was different i read satans affair beforehand highly recommend reading that first and i wasnt entirely sure what this book was going to be about i knew a past murder stalking and love were involved but that was it if you had told me one of my top reads from wouldve been a stalker romance i wouldve laughed in your face not only is the romance good and the spice is off the charts hot but the overarching story is just so goodadeline is an author who moves into her grandmothers old home after she passes away adeline was close to her grandmother and felt a pull to come back to the home that always fascinated her while living in the house she discovers family secrets that have been buried for a long time secrets involving her great grandmother her great grandmother was stalked but heres the kicker her great grandmother had a spicy affair with her stalker adelines great grandmother was murdered and she works with her best friend to figure out who did it while trying to solve this mystery adeline finds herself in the same place as her great grandmother did with a hot stalkerzade is a leader of a vigilante group thats only mission is to bring down trafficking rings and the horrible people that run them and not just any type of trafficking rings rings that are linked to very powerful people in the country and the world zade is determined to get as many women and children to safety as he can he puts himself in the line of fire to save the lives of the innocent people taken by these rings he sounds like an ideal guy right well did i mention hes also adelines stalker zade stumbles across adeline by accident and its a wrap for him he wants to make her his and theres nothing thats going to stop him now im not saying hes still not an ideal guy i do love him but lets just say these are two very opposite qualities on one hand you have this man trying to save women and child but on the other hand hes stalking a woman many would argue he cant be both a good and terrible guy at the same time but i think this book begs to differi personally loved adeline and thought she was a dynamic heroine she was sassy fun and radiated fierceness she does stand up for herself throughout the book even to zade although standing up to him doesnt do much i liked that we get her inner thoughts on zade as their relationship plays out i like watching her slowly open up to him and trust that hell protect her which seems like the opposite thing a stalker would do one of my favorite things was when adeline told her friend about one of her spicy encounters with zade and that he took her soul i couldnt be more jealous of her trust me based on the cliffhanger book two isnt going to be an easy ride for adeline but i know shes going to be okay someone as fierce as her work her way through any situation even if it takes some timei cannot explain how much i love zade i know i know hes a stalker heres the thing i just dont care he really had me contemplating if getting stalked is that bad it is but lets ignore that i loved how he was written to be so multilayered hd carlton knew what she was doing when she wrote him this way hes meant to challenge everything you know and make you wonder if hes really all that bad his qualities are so opposite of each other that he left me spinning so much throughout this book i would take pauses while reading and say out loud am i actually into this man or im in love with this unhinged man am i good i laughed way too many times when doing this because i just know how people would react in my life if i told them how much i love zade the mouth on zade is unmatched god that man says the wildest stuff but its so unbelievably hot and the things he does with his hands to adeline where do i sign up i love his love for adeline and i cant wait to see what he does in book two knowing how this book endedthe writing in this book is beautiful and so good hd carlton is talented and it shows in this book i enjoyed the different storylines taking place and how they all connected to one another i thought it was interesting to see adeline live a similar life to her great grandmother i think getting to read her great grandmothers thoughts on her own personal stalked helped adeline in her own way this book is just so so so good i cannot recommend it enough i do strongly encourage everyone consider the triggers before reading i look forward to book two,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,teen review dark,4,my daughter consumes books she said this was good but very dark for her to say that it must be pretty bad,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,this book remade my moral compass,5,just a warning do not pick up this book expecting something kind or sweet to happen it wont please check the trigger warningspremise adeline reilly is a year old indie author who has just moved into her late grandmothers gothic and creepy manor she absolutely loves thisher life is turned upside down when she caught the attention of a powerful and known vigilante who takes down trafficking rings and saves women and children for a living zade meadows is not one to be messed with especially if it involves his new found obsession adeline and when i say obsession i mean stalking i dont consider it a romance novel but yes indeed this is a dark romance emphasize on dark because nothing about this book is normally cute ill explain myselfthe story haunting adeline is a book that dives deep down into the evil side of humanity actually it dives into the side where there is none despite its dark romance label i have to unfortunately label it reality while there is romance in the book it is not your peaches and cream type romance more like blood and insanity we follow along to see adeline be stalked by zade since the moment he laid eyes on her he does everything in his power to make her his even when she says nothe world building is insanely accurate to real life it is real life hd carlton did a fantastic job at capturing the essence of what goes on in this messed up world the accuracy scared me more than the story did and thats a great thing to methe trigger warnings please read them if youre not someone like me who now looks at these lists like a shopping list then please read the warningsmy thoughts listen there are zero words i can gather to express how this book made me feel other than i love it i couldnt even tell you why maybe it has something to do with the characters it could be the level of intensity zades obsession with adeline is at maybe its that hes quite literally a walking ironic vigilante or is it that this book and the relationship to me screams deadly love at this point im convinced im just as deranged as adeline because while haunting is dark and hunting adeline is darker it had me giggling and kicking my feet like an excited year old the chokehold zade has on me is probably unhealthy but im in the accepting stage so lets roll with itconclusion im not going to sit here and lie or pretend by the end of this review you may believe im deranged maybe even crazy this story had me burning through the pages i finished it in hours to then pick up hunting and finish that in under i could not put it down yes i read the trigger warnings yes this is the first book i jumped into dark romance with no i dont regret it at all especially now because dark romance is my weakness if this is the worst out there and i just strolled through it like i was in a park then i say bring it on to othersyou will either hate this book with all your being or absolutely love it so much it hurts like me there is no in between,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,better than i expected and soooo spicy,4,this is not my genre whatsoever im an emily henry christina lauren girlie with a side of sarah j maas with frieda mcfadden and jeneva rose thrown in on occasion while i enjoy a thriller they are usually not quite this dark that being said i found this book entertaining sooo spicy whoah and all together intriguing,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,was on the edge of my seat the entire way,5,overall i loved the book i was craving something spicy and i will say it gets for spice id say if you love the smut in books this one wastes no time probably smut i also rated it because i loved how chapters were told in the perspective of the main characters i also appreciated how sometimes we would get a chapter from the manipulators perspective and then the next chapter would be the shadows perspective of the previous chapter but then it would continue or give a little more information it was thrilling to read and i highly recommend to anyone who likes smut true crime investigations and law order svu just read the damn bookspoilers belowlike seriously this is my summary so expectmajorspoilersadeline is an author who falls prey to a stalker not just an ordinary stalker but a techsaavy rich vigilante stalker who ironically saves women and children by day and stalks her by night hes no joke either he told her not to let a guy at a club touch her and so to spite him she brings him back to her house for a little woohoo action well the shadow doesnt like it and interrupts by banging on her door and then when boy wonder comes out the shadow kidnaps him and kills him slowly as a punishment to addie for not listening to him he gifts her a box with boy wonders severed hands the sexual tension and fear slowly build each chapter after that hard to believe he did her a favor but the guy she was hooking up with was actually a terrible guy any who the shadow aka zade does a bunch of messed up things but then a bunch of hell yeah things so as the reader you end up rooting for him oh and also while all this is going on adeline is trying to solved her great grandmothers murder which also involves a stalker but by the end we realize it was this guy frank a man who wanted to be her lover but kills her when he finds out she is cheating and not with him oh and shes doing this with her best friend daya who happens to work for zade doing illegal hacking stuffanywaysthe book ends with zade and jay having a gun to their heads because the underground ritual was a setup and also adeline was taken by two mafia guys at the request of max sooo i will have to read hunting adeline to find out what happensending thoughts the way this ends makes it seem like max is the one threatening jay and zade during the ritual after the explosion especially since he was the one who sent for adeline to be extracted also does the little girl and michael survive i hope they were able to get out and daya she had to be taken too since she wasnt answering her phone oh boy zade is going to be pissed,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,stars titok made me and im so glad i listened,4,okay so i was worried that this book had too much hype and wouldnt be good it also came with so many trigger warnings i though it would be hard to readfirst let me say yes there are dark themes like child trafficking and very dark romantic kinks but it doesnt go into enough detail really to warrant the extreme triggers people talk about ive read fantasy dark romances that have more blood and sadistic tendencies with more descriptionswith that being said i couldnt put it down the alternating pov is perfect and the storyline is fantastic so if you removed or skimmed over the spicy scenes due to uncomfortable the book would still grab your attentiononly reason im giving it instead of stars is because i got annoyed with adelines back and forth on her feelings and the damn foreshadowing of a pregnancy people can live happily ever after without children,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,im a complete mess right now,5,this book absolutely broke me my moral compass is so confused and oddly im okay with it im writing this review after reading books and as well as satans affair i do recommend reading the books in order starting with the novella as you are introduced to sibby zade the timelines will make sense and questions will be answered in the haunting adelinei enjoyed the love story between adeline and zade as well as the sub plot with adeline finding her grandmothers letters and learning she had a stalker as well i liked that it wasnt instalove and she actually took her time with zade the spice in this book is insane i learned things about myself to say the least lol check tws as there are heavy topics which only increases in book this book was absolutely an experience and one of my favorite booksif you have never read a dark romance before i wouldnt recommend starting with this duet,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,solid,4,hauntingadeline book one by hdcarlton comes in with a strong the book starts with sharing a playlist and a trigger warning see third picture for all sensitive content this is a wonderful cat and mouse game between author adeline reilly and her mysterious stalker z filled with intrigue murder and extra spice the book carries you through to end on a massive cliffhanger i would definitely recommend having the second and final book on hand the only complaint i have is that in several places seemed clipped and cut short a little choppy other than that its a good book and i would definitely recommend,positive
haunting adeline cat and mouse duet,its disturbingly good,5,can i just say i had no idea that i would ever be reading a book like this as a writer myself i was sucked in by the authors words i almost felt as though adeline was really hd carlton in disguise she really is the manipulatorspoiler alertadeline and zade they are kind of perfect for each otheradeline is strong willed and outspoken she has no problem saying how she feels she tends to do this throughout the first book her smart mouth lands her into a lot of trouble and i must say i am intrigued because i am that way myselfzade is a self made man he works to rectify the injustices of human trafficking and despite being noble and striving to change the world he becomes infatuated with our girl adeline obsession at first sighti loved the cat and mouse chase it was perfect and like i said i couldnt put it downcharacter development is my number one thing in books i cannot stand a romance book that has zero character development and just mindless sex scenes but haunting went above and beyond my expectationsi loved the back story and the inclusion of the past with the present adelines curiosity about her grandmothers death the diary her history with her mother it was so easy to follow despite being loaded with details that anyone can easily miss in fact i reread the book a second time and then caved and got the audiobook which has the best voice narrators if i may add i normally hate the audiobook versions of books mainly because i find that the voice narrators give the characters no personality and their performance feels so dry it makes me not want to finish listening but the voice narrators selected for this bookoh my lordhaunting was the type of read where i found myself questioning a lot of things mainly with myself and my own tastes i never thought i would be able to read such a dark book but wow i was entrappedi have purchased hunting adeline and cannot wait to dive into the next one,positive
verity,dark twisted shocking lives up to the hype,4,verity opens with author lowen ashleigh having a very bad morning her mother died the previous week after a yearlong battle with colon cancer lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me she relates but still brought her to lowens apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child afraid of what lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes now she has left her apartment in new york city for the first time in weeks summoned to a meeting at her publishers office by her literary agent corey with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship just as lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck lowen is understandably shaken and the mans blood is splattered on her face and white shirta handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back they chat briefly and loewn concludes that he wants to be invisible in this city just like me after all she moved to new york to become part of the citys invisible millions of invisible residents her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them something she has refused to do in the past im so awkward im afraid once my readers meet me in person theyll swear off my books forever lowen laments thats why i stay home and write i think the idea of me is better than the reality of me but another contract was her last hope she took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money now having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mothers estate and be homeless soon unless she receives a job offerwhen lowen arrives at her publishers office she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting he is jeremy crawford husband of verity a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventyfive thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series with the first installment due in six months lowen is determined to turn down the offer until jeremy informs her that he selected her because verity read one of lowens books and it was among her favorites she purportedly told jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and lowen was destined to be the next big thing verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident following the deaths of both of her daughters chastin and harper leaving jeremy to raise their young son crew alone lowen ultimately agrees to take on the projectlowen makes the sixhour drive to the crawford home in vermont listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route she is to spend time in veritys office reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book lowen meets crew and learns that veritys condition is extremely serious she is in a virtually catatonic state uncommunicative and unable to care for herself caregivers spend the day in the home with jeremy managing at night lowen soon discovers that veritys office lacks organization her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files and boxes containing more documents line the walls clearly the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than lowen originally anticipated as she begins reading veritys second book she realizes the books are from the villains point of view and she will need time to work myself into that mindset while writing jeremy claims that he has never read veritys books because he didnt like being inside her headauthor colleen hoover recounts lowens story via a firstperson narrative with the story really taking off as lowen attempts to settles into the crawford home she is keenly observant and inquisitive about veritys writing as well as her family and quickly finds herself attracted to jeremy who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom searching through veritys office lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled so be it verity hopes it is an outline for the next book but it is instead an autobiography drafted by verity reading it is not what she has been hired to do but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research i need to see how veritys mind works to understand her as a writer soon she is absorbed in veritys descriptions of meeting jeremy the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage as well as her pregnancies and motherhood the more she reads the more frightened of verity lowen becomes especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about veritys condition nonetheless lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the crawford familys history and gain insight into jeremy and veritys marriage but lowen is playing a dangerous game veritys purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of veritys feelings motivations and unspeakably vile acts lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of veritys life and concludes that it was written by a very disturbed woman a woman whose house i currently inhabithoover ramps up the tension as lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with jeremy influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript veritys revelations are horrifying and as lowen and jeremy grow closer he increasingly opens up to her sharing details of his life with verity about which lowen feigns ignorance lowens suspicions about the accident in which verity was injured grow is jeremy being completely honest with lowen why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with lowen when his wife although injured is still alive he claims that he cannot move verity to a care facility because crew cannot sustain another loss while verity is cared for in their home crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of jeremys daughters were their deaths really tragic accidents is crew safehoovers characters are both fascinating and infuriating the story is related solely from lowens perspective her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother she has achieved modest success as a writer but because of her discomfort in social situations her career growth has been stymied she accepts the offer to write veritys next three books because she desperately needs the money but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up but she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to jeremy but the incongruity between what she has been told about veritys accident and what transpires in the house of course lowens feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript interestingly hoover has said that even when she depicts lowen reading veritys manuscript readers are still not fully in veritys head because were always in lowens perspective reading something she found when i write a book from one characters point of view i rarely think about the story from the other characters perspectives sometimes its necessary for certain scenes but with this book it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear lowen felt so as the author i had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone elses perspectives still as the story progresses hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable lowen really is she believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate and that jeremy is not the villain if in fact there is a villain in the crawfords story but could lowen possibly be opportunistic calculating and willing to do anything to be with jeremyjeremy is equally captivating he is handsome charming successful and by all outward appearances a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise to be fair although veritys prognosis is never affirmatively established his desire to move on with his life is understandable verity sustained a serious head injury which will in all likelihood preclude her from resuming a fully normal life but was his meeting with lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publishers office really just coincidental did he intend for her to find the manuscript in veritys office has he been fully aware of its contents all along about that hoover says im not sure because i was never in jeremys head in other words readers can draw their own conclusions based on the evidence hoover does presentand what about verity is she selfishly conniving and evil as the manuscript suggests or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accidentthe manuscript provides myriad complications lowen debates whether she should discuss it with jeremy she doesnt believe he is aware of its existence or content he claimed he never read veritys books after all lowen learns that verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree but there were no skidmarks on the pavement she concludes verity either fell asleep or she did it on purpose does it matter to lowen which scenario is accurate what conclusion has jeremy drawn about the cause of the accidentputting aside the perspective from which the story is told no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that verity originally published in continues to be one of the mostdiscussed psychological thrillers ever written there is even a facebook discussion group devoted to the book boasting nearly twentyfive thousand members the book is fastpaced engrossing and extremely entertaining the storys pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breathtaking revelations of the truth or perhaps a manipulated version of the truth the tale careens to a jawdropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking discussing and debating hoovers extremely clever and nuanced tale as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought for a very very long time hoover says she chose the ending because its frightening to me its my biggest nightmare for the darkness in the worlds i create as a writer to somehow intrude into her real lifethanks to grand central publishing for a copy of the book,positive
verity,great idea perfect first hoover read,4,review if you want to just know right off how i feel i loved it i love the slow roll and unlocking of the story and secrets i loved the climax and denouement it all just worked and did it for me this book was a sprint for me and there are no slow or unneeded parts it was like eating the perfectly sized meali read this book in three days but i was trying to savor it and could have easily read it in less i thought all the characters were likable and nothing felt forcedafter i read this i spent the rest of the night trying to decide who i thought the villain was was there a villain im still not sure i love books like this where you get to decide and it isnt told to you the main character i think we can all see a part of ourselves in herthe love story feels authentic i could see this actually happening and probably happens all the time sometimes love doesnt have to make sense or make other happy its visceral and honest despite the belief that we shouldnt be doing this also the spicy scenes were very good and made me blush a couple timesthe setting seems beautiful and i want to go therethe ending was great and i really want to know more of what happens next i wish it were longer but i also dont want it to be ruined see the next bullet pointi think this would be a great series same characters different secrets and it could be like a v c andrews dollanger family multigenerational chaos this isnt actually a dislike but i know there are no plans for additional books so it belongs hereas you can tell this are fake and i dont really have any nitpicky things,positive

verity,i could not put this one down,5,i cannot remember the last time that a book consumed my attention it was most likely when i was in th grade and the first harry potter book came outthe writing is easy to read and transports you in a way that you feel like you are standing right there with the main character almost as if you could see yourself acting and responding the same way she doesthe plot keeps you on your toes and guessing even after the last chapter has ended i would highly recommend this book for a monthly book club pick there is so much to dissect and discuss and i dare say many readers would have a variety of opinions on what the actual truth ison a more tangible note the book itself a light and paperback the text is a good size and easy to read the paper used is thin and you can see pigment coming through the backside of the page which is not my preference however it did not take away from my reading overall in addition the book can be held open easily unlike many books where if you laid it down it would immediately close on itselfdo yourself a favor and grab a copy you wont regret it,positive
verity,holy cow,5,i knew this one was supposed to me twisty and a mindflip so i was waiting it for it throughout but it wasnt the things i had predicted in my guesses though i loved this book and was on the edge of my seat through the majority of the story the characters setting romance steam suspense and mystery were all perfect and perfectly balancedwhich i find to be a difficult task in a romantic suspensemystery book it was worth the hype and one of my favorite coho books so far perfect for october and spooky season definitely a must read,positive
verity,definitely a page turner,4,i read this over a leisurely weekend and found it to be a page turner of unexpected twists and turns the storyline is exciting and original i usually dont read psychological thrillers because the dark notes of evil minds repel my senses and there is plenty of that accosting us in the real world however this was complex enough to hold my attention without being overly dark i was intrigued and couldnt put it down however the reliance on too many descriptive sex scenes got old a fun but weird read,positive
verity,fun story too much language,4,i dont tend to look at things as deeply as most people mostly its just did i enjoy this and the answer is yesthe first chapter seemed to be going for a lot of shock value but it was enough to keep me readingall the fbombs were not as bad as something like fifty shades but there were still way too many of themi read the whole thing in about hours though since it was good enough to suck me in id definitely recommend it to friends though,positive
verity,oh my wow,5,i am not easily impressed by a lot of books i can easily figure out a lot of plots i didnt see this one coming this book leaves you feeling horrified uncomfortable and shocked and is such a good read while this isnt a crime type book if you enjoy watching crime shows and mysteries you will like this one,positive
verity,deep and dark,5,i love how this book is written differently than the typical hoover books it creates this different scene that more people can relate to than most would like to admit i loved the suspense so much that once i started i didnt put it down until i finished,positive
verity,colleen hoover does it again,5,i thought this book had a broader mass appeal than some of hoovers other books which are always a quick light read there were a number of young men in my office that also loved reading this book,positive

a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,feyre is healing from under the mountain but is she really spoilers,5,o i loved this book along with every other reader however its not my favorite book in the series im writing this online review after completing the series but from the notes i took while reading for the first timeo we certainly do love a rhysand show dont we we all made the mistake of liking tamlin in the first book youre not alone i love rhys character so much brooding bad boy with the good reasons we love thato overview spoilers feyre returned to the spring court with tamlin only to find that tamlin had become so overprotective of her she wasnt allowed to leave the manor so she stayed there planning for everything with ianthe the priestess that tamlin had brought in planning the wedding planning the flowers things that she couldnt have cared any less about we find feyre falling more and more into the darkness however while she is there fighting with tamlin on everything rhysand shows up to make good on his bargain after months of peace where everyone assumed hed forgotten about it although she doesnt want to go she does and there she learns to read and write because rhys saw in the trials that she couldnt he teaches her with sentences like rhysand is the most handsome high lord and the like we love that for him his twisted sense of humor and narcissismo however feyre captures a suriel our favorite gossip queen and he tells her stay with the high lord and see everything righted so the day of the wedding of tamlin and feyre feeling like she is doing as the suriel told her comes and she has a hideous dress that she hates on that ianthe picked out as she is walking own the isle toward tamlin she is silently shouting in her head for anyone to stop it she is beginning to panic and a special dark knight in shining armor shows up just in time as feyre stopped in the aisle because she couldnt go any further rhys then whisks her awayo there she decides that she is not returning to the spring court and being locked in that houseo so begins feyres real healing at velaris and the night courto i did indeed love this book so much feyres internal struggle just fractured my heart throughout the entire thing her spiraling into despair and tamlin not noticing but rhys noticing that she was coming to him during his weeks frail and full of nothing was so amazingo watching their characters develop a relationship was amazing i understand why this book is the favorite of the entire series,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,all hail high lord rhys,4,i really debated rating this one higher cause i gave acotar four stars and i definitely liked this one better but it didnt quite feel like a or star read im so consistent anyway getting into my actual thoughtswhere do i find myself an illyrian like for real how is it that rhys cassian and azriel are all the actual bestfollowing the trend ive seen i love rhys and tamlin can go rot in hell thats how much i disliked him in this book i loved seeing how much under the mountain affected feyre and i really liked all of her interactions with the inner circle the inner circle in general is like actually the best part of this bookthe tension is so freaking good i think the tension itself was better than the spice though the spice was but only because the tension was soooo damn good its like pages of tension and buildup and i was dying but loving it obviouslyit was such a great fantasy read to jump into and finish within like hours though i am kicking myself for not having acowar already in my house before i finished this one definitely make sure you have the whole series readyspoiler talki wasnt a fan of elaine and lucien being mates like first of all i didnt love lucien in this one but also it just felt too ironic and feyre has the same thought but it doesnt make it better im feeling a nesta and cassian mates plot line i dont hate it but it still feels weird that all three sisters randomly have mates that are in close proximity to each othermor and azriel the ending felt weird and maybe a little rushed idk the book just felt like a mcguffin i dont understand the deal with the cauldron and i dont know how much i love that feyre and rhys were able to trick the big bad villain so easily it was just mehalso what is with sjm and intentionally holding back major plot points from readers just to surprise us i was somewhat okay with it when it was just aelin doing it in tog but im not a fan of it here id rather know their plan and feel the suspense of can they pull it off than being blindsided,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,the ending was stunning as always but i had character issues,4,warning this is not a spoilerfree review like i usually write i wont give away twists from the very end but i will be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book i was pleasantly surprised when i read a court of thorns and roses last year because going into it i knew it was a story with a strong fae presence by this point in time in my reading career i wasnt new to fantasy but i was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy i liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themes but knowing how much i loved sarahs throne of glass series and the fae presence there i dove into acotar and loved it it had a bit of a breaking dawn ending so i wasnt quite sure where the second book would go but naturally i had very very high hopes for it since i hadnt been let down by a maas book yeti wont sugar coat it it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book i was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and i just didnt feel like things were moving forward there was a lot of time spent on feyres ptsd from her time under the mountain and i absolutely understand and dont think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over i do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though acomaf isnt a short book and i think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning if the book were more characterbased instead of plotdriven it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isnt the first time i felt this way in a maas book either i understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but i felt like i was reading about totally different characters when i started acomaf feyre and tamlin were just not themselves and i think had acotar ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout acomaf it wouldnt have been as much of a surprise i just really felt like i was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to especially since i had read acotar over a year before i got to start acomafi continued to have issues with feyre throughout the book i dont know why but she was just really bothering me instead of snarky witty comebacks i felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone it was really hard to watch her interact with characters and i started to latch onto new or newtothespotlight characters like rhysand and his gang it did make me extra thankful for rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up though the interactions between feyre and tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read then i ended up on the flip side where although i didnt want feyre and tamlin to still be together i also felt really weird that tamlin was almost totally absent from this book he was there in the beginning and i wont speak of the ending but this book was straight up about feyre and rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between feyre and tamlin in acotar to have it totally change i absolutely love where it went but its confusing to understand why the feyretamlin romance was so important and developed in acotar and why rhysand wasnt more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the doorive followed the romances in sarah j maas books quite well i think considering theyre not always simple and straightforward i know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their otps with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and i feel like ive followed along with that fairly easily i can see where people feel like the romance in acomaf is a love triangle and i guess to a certain extent it is but feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time it is quite complicated though so if youre sensitive about triangles you almost definitely wont like the romancei personally loved the development of rhysand as a love interest especially once feyre really started to struggle with tamlin i found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives feyre and tamlin drifted apart and just couldnt find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together that doesnt always mean that you shouldnt be with someone but in the case of story telling its a pretty big sign that the main character isnt where they should be ive heard this complaint from other maas readers but this is the first of her books where i really felt like the romance started to take over the book while i did love the new rhysandfeyre development i felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major finally happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so its not like i wanted it to be downplayed but i just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy and yes there are some cheesy romance bookworthy moments lets just say this is not a young adult book friends there are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directingteaching teens who are reading this series you may not want to put this book directly into their hands not that im saying censor them but ya know read it first so you know what youre giving themthe sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful sarah j maas is still a master at layering stories and its so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book there were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from acomaf and see from a different characters perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter the book was simply addicting and i couldnt wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and its so fun to watch that develop the ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why i had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book so many things were revealed actions taken and trusts betrayed that i just really didnt know what was coming the twists and surprises were epic and once again i was left in utter anticipation of the next book,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,i was a survivor and i was strong i would not be weak or helpless again,5,review originally posted on goodreadsi was not a pet not a doll not an animal i was a survivor and i was strong i would not be weak or helpless again i would not could not be broken tameda court of thorns and roses was one of the first books i started reading that got me into fantasy and reviewing books way back when this series the throne of glass series and sarah j maas herself wasnt hyped up like theres no tomorrow it was the first book ive read by sarah j maas and the reason i picked up the throne of glass series because i just needed more sjm in my lifei was satisfied with the way things ended in acotar so when i heard that some changes were going to be made in a court of mist and fury i was a little disappointed i was not a fan of the changes that were made in the throne of glass series which was why i havent picked up queen of shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day its been released thats just my opinion i know some sjm fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that sarah could absolutely do no wrong dont get me wrong i love sarah j maas she is an outstanding author i love her writing her characters and the world that she brings to life it was her books that changed my perspective on young adult fantasy but i honestly wouldnt say that i agree with every direction that sjm takes with her booksi suppose the questions to ask now are what was my stance at the end of acotar and how did i perceive the changes that were made after reading acomaflet me address the most important aspect of sarah j maass books this series and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most the romance since a court of thorns and roses was a loose retelling of beauty and the beast my ship of course was none other than tamlin and feyre i loved them as individuals and i loved them even more as a couple and i loved rhysand just not as a love interest i felt like feyre wasnt worthy of the enigma that was rhysand but knowing the trend that sjm follows in all of her books i figured a change in love interests was inevitable after all a book isnt written by sarah j maas if there isnt some character butchering and changes in love interests involvedbut after reading a court of mist and fury i actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise as much as i wanted tamlin and feyre to stay together i knew it wasnt going to happen these two people that survived werent the same people that were under the mountain theyre relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy it was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happenin the beginning of this series i understood where tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of feyre it was for feyres own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love andor care about but he took it way too far he became too overbearing to the point where he was holding feyre back we all understood the trials and suffering that feyre had to go through but i feel like people dont acknowledge what tamlin had to go through as well while they were under the mountain it was nothing close to what feyre had to go through but tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die he couldnt protect her the way he wanted and he didnt fight for her as he knew he very well could have he was helpless and a coward i think he realized this which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where shes being suffocated it still doesnt excuse what tamlin does in this book but hes just another damaged character like feyre and rhysand hes just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book tamlin loves feyre that much is evident he just loves her too much and that is the tragedyas for rhysand all i can say is that i loved him in acotar and i loved him even more in a court of mist and fury i loved that we finally get a good understanding of rhys as a character the secrets hes kept and the sacrifices hes made for the good of his people and his court he was everything that tamlin was not and twice the man and high lord that tamlin will ever be im not completely sure if im on board with feyre and rhysand yet but i love their chemistry friendship and the way they just understand and respect one another i think i wouldve been head over heels in love with feyre and rhys instantly as a couple if acotar never happened and i didnt get so attached to feyre and tamlin but i no longer ship tamlinfeyre and im slowly but surely beginning to fall in love with rhysand and feyre little by littlewith romance aside everything about a court of mist and fury turned out every bit as great as i anticipated a year ago sarah j maas did not disappoint i was preparing myself for the worst but instead i got the best sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing worldbuilding and characters that she has created of all the new things that were introduced in this book the new characters of the night court were definitely my favorite i thought the spring court was great in acotar with characters like lucien and alis but the night court was at a whole new level with cassian azriel morrigan and amren badass is literally an understatement describing these new charactersbesides rhysand and feyre acomaf introduced so many new ships and i cant handle all the perfectness that everyone is i now ship mor and azriel with all of my being just putting it out there xd and cassian and nesta and lucian and elain none for you tamlinoverall i was glad i waited to read a court of mist and fury because as a result i was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that sarah j maas was taking the series love her or hate her sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow i think a court of mist and fury was even better than acotar in more ways than one sometimes i find that sequels may suffer middle book syndrome but acomaf amplifies that momentum knowing that sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the a court of thorns and roses trilogy,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,hello feyre darling he purred,5,im in loveacomaf is a wonderful continuation of feyres story that continues to build out the absolutely stunning world maas has created the expansion of the world is easy to follow but deliciously detailed as it expands our horizons literally and figuratively the pace of world building is easy enough for a reader new to fantasy to follow but not too slow for an avid fantasy readerthe character development explodes in this book leading to extremely satisfying realizations twists and turns for both the reader and the characters we finally get some relationship dynamics we didnt even know we were missing in acotarjust like acotar there were moments where my emotions got the best of me while reading acomaf i feel physical reactions to some of the scenes truly engulfing me in the storyacotar and acomaf continue to tighten their claws around me as i dive headfirst into the next bookto the stars who listenand the dreams that are answered,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,loved it,5,i loved everything about this book and it was better than the first bookimo theres so much action friendship and relationship build uptheres so much we learn about the night court and about rhys not only do we see feyre learn and grow into her fae powers we also see her relationship grow with rhys as well we are also introduced to the close friends of rhyss which brings out a whole new side of himthere was a lot of tension and build up to the spicy parts of this book even though the author goes into detail in maybe to spicy scenes it was what we all were waiting for between feyre and rhys for that i will rate it a for spice,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,i devoured this book in less than days,5,this is the first series in my life that i cannot have any sort of break between books i finished the fist one and was ready this one within the hour i havent been this captivated this involved this in love this heated cause holy moly i was squirming towards the end this heartbroken by a book before as i am with this i was waiting for rhys and feyre to finally take they next step and they would get so close and i would get so excited but then they would hold off again leaving me all flustered but what an endingi love the family that feyre finally has in this book the love and respect they have for one another is what anyone wants in their group of friends and to see feyre come from such trauma and sadness into a world of protection without suffocation adoration for who she is as a person not just because of what made her into high fae the support and encouragement its nothing short of heart wrenching when you yourself dont have that kind of group in your lifei already finished this one and i am already on the third i cant wait to keep reading this series i have a feeling ill put the th book down pick up the first and start all over again just so i dont ever have to believe its over,positive
a court of mist and fury a court of thorns and roses,rhysand you hurry up and read this book,5,this book was everything i had hoped it would and so much more i loved it as much as i love rhysland there i said it theres romance sensuality character growth action betrayal friendships family ties and so much more the character developments the story telling the world building and the way maas wrote this story is awesome this book is the packaged deal okay ill admit it rhysand is the packaged deal in this booki knew there was much more to rhysand than we got to know in a court of thorns and roses boy is there a lot more to him i loved the way i got to know him in this book maas held things back from readers allowing us to get to know rhysand as feyre got to know him part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character the more i got to know him the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and tamlin rhysland is that character you want on your side hes loyal to those close to him doesnt apologize for who he really is doesnt hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone and unlike some characters he sees feyre for all that she really is and allows her to be who she is and all that shes becomingdespite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants rhysland gives feyre choices and allows her to make them he wants her to be who she wants to be rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of and fall in love with in the process i love the way he treats feyre and his court hes very powerful someone to fear yet for all the darkness that resides within him i came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to feyre he is that person who isnt only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court hes someone who knows how to treat to a woman he treats feyre with so much love respect and understanding sigh just wait until you see how he treats her you wont be able to resist falling for him either ive completely fallen in love with his characterfeyre by all means is an equal to rhys not only did i love their banter electric chemistry and those hot scenes between them i swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times i loved how she fell for rhysand the more i got to know him the more i understood how she slowly started to fall for him it was natural and made sense most importantly i loved that she realized she is worth so much more than shes ever thought i loved that she grew into a strong fierce characterwomen who not only learned to love herself but love someone who truly loved her and didnt want to keep her in a cage i loved that she learned to fight and embrace her powers both literally and figuratively she grew so much and i loved that she became a force to reckon with what i admired the most about feyres character development in this book is that she learned to love herself she learned to embrace who she is and all that she is i respected her even more for thatthe romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire the banter and flirting between rhysand and feyre was well thats just say these two know how to push each others buttons and get under each others skin in all the right ways together feyre and rhysland are something amazing aside from all the physical aspects and passion these two share i love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other they both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with they are each others hope and light theyre there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmaresone of the things i liked about theme of love in this book is the way feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love vs what she thought love was i appreciated the fact that maas doesnt just tell her readers this she shows us through character actions we see it through feyres realization of what rhysands been telling her and how he treats her vs how tamlin treats her tamlins fall from grace is that he didnt respect feyre enough to allow her to be herself he didnt treat her like an equal but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession i may have got the why in that but i didnt agree with it at all the contrast between how rhysand and tamlin both treated feyre was painfully obvious through out the bookmaas has a way with creating indepth characters i really come to care about she effortlessly brings them to life as well as their stories and vividly detailed worlds i loved getting to go deeper into the fey world being introduced to more characters and seeing the different parts of their world i loved getting to know the night court maas has always created characters that really add depth to the story and the night court was no different i loved meeting and getting to know rhyss inner circle these characters werent only friends they are family and it really showed in their story along with the night court which has become my favorite court i loved seeing more of the other characters and learning about their histories and ties together with their courts i felt every range of emotion possible while reading this book i laughed i cried i cheered i swooned got swept off my feet was happy angry at a certain someone and i completely fell in love with all that this book offered me i officially have a book hang over sarah j maas what have you done to me the turn of events the character developments and the over all story are that good i feel bad for the next book i read after this one because i already had to reread this book once because it was so good i dont even know what else i can say other than that is one heck of an awesome sequel now the torture will be waiting a whole another for the next bookthere are sensual scenes and well written sex scenes through out the book as well as the use of the fword a few times through out the book making it a book that may not be suitable for younger ya readers,positive
the creative act a way of being,if inspiration does not come to lead the way we show up anyway,5,released in the creative act a way of being by rick rubin is a bible of highly quotable material that all artists should readrubin a music producer of such acts including the beastie boys red hot chili peppers and even jayz is like a zen master his expertise lies in what he hears and how he is able to suggest and or push an artist to dig deeper or go father or think differently than they currently dojust think of him as an oraclethe creative act as the title states can refer to whatever type of art you are studying or producing whether you are a musician photographer painter or designer it doesnt matter every single thing he discusses within this book applies i found it to be one of the best books that i have ever read on the subject of creativity it should be a required reading book for anyone in art school or trying to master a given crafteach chapter is short and covers a variety of topics including creativity awareness selfdoubt experimentation momentum and success just to name a few here are just a handful of great quotes that i found inspiring i hope you read this book and become inspired toothe objective is not to learn to mimic greatness but to calibrate our internal meter for greatness so we can better make the thousands of choices that might ultimately lead to our own great workwere all different and we are all imperfect and the imperfections are what makes each of us and our work interestingdistraction is not procrastination procrastination consistently undermines our ability to make things distraction is a strategy and service of the workyou are never alone when youre making art you are in a constant dialogue with what is an what wasif we are aiming to create works that are exceptional most rules dont apply average is nothing to aspire toif inspiration does not come to lead the way we show up anyway,positive
the creative act a way of being,helpful advice from a trusted source,4,wanted to recommend rick rubins book the creative act a way of being to all my artist friends out there looking for some fresh inspiration or even a gift for younger artists just starting outwhat has fascinated me about rick rubin is how he has had so much success as a record producer but with such diverse array of iconic musical artists such as the beastie boys red hot chili peppers johnny cash tom petty and the avett brothers all artists i greatly admire for their authenticity that there must be something very fundamentally sound in his approach and methodsrecently i have been seeing a lot of interesting videos of rubin talking about creativity on tik tok and youtube and thought the book is better might apply here and it is it reminds me of a modernday version of robert henris the art spiritwhat i personally wanted to learn more about was rubins involvement with tom pettys wildflowers album which i view as tom pettys artistic peak considering that tom petty started writing songs in and wildflowers was made years later for a late bloomer guy like me this is very important knowledge to have but rubin never actually talks specifically about any of the artists he has worked with he gives a lot of practical advice on how to break out of creative ruts and how to collaborate lots of pearls of wisdom on the whole creative process of selecting and nurturing seeds of ideas crafting them into works of art and then deciding when it is time to release them into the world move ahead and start anewhe does however speak about the artists muse he calls it source the short version is that source is a neverending cycle of metaphysical energy a riverlike current that ebbs and flows very much like the seasons of the earth human beings channel this energy into art as it is destined to be created by those ready to receive it and art is life because it is a manifestation of the way humans think and feel about life as long as there is life there will be artthere is a lot written in this book about selfawareness and being in harmony with the world maybe it is rubin who learned from petty that tom petty just instinctively knew that he would never run out of ideas or things to create as long as he knew how to tune in to the sourcebecause and be warned that there are also lots of phrases like we are dealing in a magic realm nobody knows why or how it works and the best work is the work you are excited about which are true if not obvious and a bit annoying if not for so many of them because they end up sounding like empty platitudes and salesmenshipthe book is also over pages and many a blank space at the end of each chapter to perhaps write notes a cynic would look at the page inflation as a marketing ploy or ego inflation or maybe even a little of bothoverall the book is of value to those who create its well written its as if a wise person a trusted sourceso to speakis talking directly to you coaching you up in their gentle but very specific manner i love that,positive
the creative act a way of being,stupid logical great reminder effectively motivational,5,if youve read as many of these kinds of books as i have dont expect anything new but that is far from a bad thingif youre looking for a distilled and potent reminder of what it is to live and breathe the creative life this book is for youas a film director artist and creative director i typically read heavily dense books on this kind of subject matter this is just a breath of fresh air not unlike david lynchs catching the big fish which i highly recommendi read this book front to back in a few lazy days its an easy read no doubt but its also an amazingly great reminder of everything the creative mind must retain on a daily basis after i read through it once my hopes desires and passion were rekindledthen if youre anything like me every once in a while youll open it up to any page at random and be reminded of a snippet of inspiration and advice that does nothing more and nothing less than remind you of the importance of curiosity and connection with the world around youa must have at first its a simple distillation of what you already feel and know then it becomes a friend that keeps you on the road of the creative journey,positive
the creative act a way of being,this book is something very special and here is why,5,there are many books on a single craft but few on all craft this is one on creativity that any person who would like to explore their creativity can use to get better also people who already consider themselves creators be it writing music painting or any other artform can bask in ricks wisdom on how to become a master which he certainly is this is a very special book that will be around for decades the audiobook is amazing i love it some much i got the book too enjoy,positive
the creative act a way of being,if you are an artist a book not to be missed,5,i cannot find the right word to describe as gem is not enough to tell i dont know rick nor heard of him before the book is a referral from a friend i would say it arrives comes to my life at the most beautiful time if you are an artist you will resonate with it in full and feeling the sense of belonging to appreciate all the gift inside you even no one will see or agree with what you see what you feel a book an artist will find ecstasy i love the chapter being short and precise quick to the point that one will never lose their focus trying to figure out what author is talking by reading many pages for one simple message thanks to rick rubin decided to release this without alternating any content in the interest of publisher but keep the very original work of his own after years of writing a must read thumbs up art,positive
the creative act a way of being,deserves to be on the book shelf of artists and writers for sure,4,i cant say i am a fan of rubins personal philosophy hes an idealist who deals mostly in the emotional approach while i like the simplicity and straightforwardness of it i prefer realism and logic but still i am impressed by his approach and his method i also like the nontraditional format of his book the formatting choices were borderline esoteric and thats nice to see most mainstream publishers or even midlevel publishers would have never allowed that book to go to print without heavy editing but then who is not going to give rick rubin what he wants i expected fauxguru platitudes for the simpleminded masses and while some of the book was indeed that much of it was genuinely insightful,positive
the creative act a way of being,you wont be disappointed,5,this was exactly what i needed to read i thought it would be more about technical production stuff but it was more about the essence of art and who you are simply beautiful im not the best reader but this book kept me engaged from start to finish,positive
the creative act a way of being,the most important question it asks is why make art the answer to connect,5,this book was a wonderful treatise on what it means to be and live as an artist it is comprised of short chapters each more a musing than anything certain as a selfproclaimed artist many of the ideas proposed were things i had considered before but they were still refreshing to hear from a living artistic legend like rick rubin cofounder of def jam records and winner of eight grammy awards as he writes artists allow us to see what we are unable to see but somehow already know this is how i felt reading his bookmany of my friends who work traditional jobs ones with a start time and an end time sometimes ask me when my weekend is the thing is artists dont really take time off do we go on vacation sure but we never turn ourselves off from drinking in what life has to offer for who knows when that next seed of an idea will present itself one that we must surely plant and nurture it is the artists job to always remain open and ready to receive these seedshow do we know when a work is finished of course there is no correct answer it is more of a feeling we work until it is done sometimes a project requires long grueling hours and sometimes creating is a short and pleasant endeavor regardless what medium of art we are crafting in the amount of time we put in and the results we get are rarely in balance a large movement may materialize all at once other times a tiny detail may take days and theres no predicting how much of a role either will play in the final outcome as someone who has written music for over a decade i can attest that this is trueone of the hardest aspects of being an artist is feeling successful what happens when we publish a book but fail to get anybody to read it or film a movie that nobody watches or produce a song that nobody hears luckily rubin has an answer for this quandary of the soul as well reminding us that success has nothing to do with variables outside yourself once we have finished with our current work and are ready to release it to the world we are successful it is something that occurs in the privacy of the soulfrom finding ideas crafting them editing them believing in them releasing them getting feedback all the way to starting again rubins book touches on every aspect of living the creative life it is full of wisdom that i will surely revisit in times of needthe most important question it asks is why make artthe answer to connect,positive

demon copperhead a pulitzer prize winner,i found myself challenged and yes strangely blessed,4,demon copperhead holy moley what a book its one of those books i made myself put down just because i didnt want to finish it too soon at the same time its one i probably wouldnt have read at all except that a friend recommended it based on the fact that one of my own writing projects is dealing with some of the same themes that plus its connection to david copperfield and the almost lyrical prose of the free sample chapters convinced me to pay the exorbitantforkindle price of the whole bookwell im glad i did demon copperhead is one of those books that gets in your head and stays stuck there until you finish and even afterward your pages turn a mile a minute because not only do you want the characters to be okay you want to know what happens you want to see demon and his compatriots either triumph over their hardships or if they choose a path that wont end there at least get to an ending that makes sense and leaves a logical and lasting impression which in both cases oh boy do they these characters dont just feel like real people they are real i know i say that a lot but man i was not one of them i was your classic straighta straight edge student who went home to stable parents every night but i knew these kids existed i lived still live in a town with problems and stories similar to lee countys i didnt have the same problems or story as demon but straight as and straight edge or not i had my own reasons for being lets say in the orphan class of my circle like demon i spent a lot of years feeling like i had a lot of shine but if it came off people would see coal underneath and be repulsedbeyond that barbara kingsolver just plain nailed these characters these settings this life story of her modern appalachian david copperfield i not only felt for but felt with and not only traveled with but traveled inside demon all the way from his home next door to the peggotts to creakys farm to the mccobbs to coach winfields and everywhere in between i cant say every place and character was one i grew to love i mean come on some of these people are downright cruel or downright creeps but they were threedimensional and i could at least understand them and even the situations and scenes at which i cringed left an impression on me special mention goes tothe squadron at creaky farm every kid needs a friend like tommy i dont care who or how old you are and as dysfunctional as the squadron was i got behind the brotherhood ive written situations and characters like that not as well as barbara has ill grant you the commitment to survival the heart the unbroken spirits will do something to youdemons developing drawing talent and cartoons i loved seeing those from his first superhero drawings all the way up to the red neck comic strip i kept thinking how would he draw me and i loved how barbara gave this resilient roughedged character an artistic soft side without making him a stereotypical beta male or heaven forbid what folks in appalachia might think of as a sissymr armstrong and ms annie of course not just because theyre good teachers trying to save the poor foster kid either which ive seen done and done poorly no you get the sense theyre learning and growing right alongside demon making their own mistakes and learning how to save up and give away their own juice plus i absolutely loved mr armstrongs way of showing his students their history and how it has contributed to their current poverty educational lack drugrelated temptations and etcangus winfield oh my gosh i just love her to bits she is the coolest and least stereotypical high school student youd ever want to meet if we were in high school together we mightve blown each other off but id like to think we couldve been friends maybe we wouldve reluctantly partnered for one of those stupid antarctica projects and laughed over the fact that bettina cook thought penguins lived with santa at the north poleaside from settings and characters barbara also nailed her themes as mentioned the one that sticks with me the most is the history present situation and future outlook for the kids of appalachia especially considering the current prescription drug situation now again i was not one of those kids and am not one of those adults but having lived with cerebral palsy from birth having gotten nothing but the runaround and the we give up youre too highfunctioning from those who shouldve fallen all over themselves to helpyeah i got demons frustrations from a different place its no picnic when over of your income comes from a government checkand thats with fouryear college aunt june so yeah i was with mr armstrong and ms annie and angus wake up stupid school board napping principal whoever get off your butt and give these kids a future even if it has to start with one little academic team wake up medical system one kids overdosed mom oughta be enough to make you think whats going on with these prescription drugs wake up social services what part of filthy farmhouse slave labor and flat broke family with four kids under seven dont you getthe other themes especially resilience jump off the page too i rooted for demon the whole time because as mr armstrong says he is the driver he walked out of the major car wreck not once but many times sometimes i cringed at his naivete as with the original david copperfield especially when it came to emmy and particularly dori who i felt sorry for but my lord but pair that resilience with the darker side of the human condition such as which lives get celebrated and which lives just get the casket lid closed on them and it shines all the brighterseveral scenes popped all over the book so many it would take too much time to enumerate them all and some i cant tell you about without spoiling the ending although the ending is that little bit of hope and happiness i hung on for and you do have to hang on through a lot one reason i took a star is sheer length this thing is a doorstop now thats not a problem on its own barbara kingsolver is kinda known for doorstops but it doesnt work as well here as ive seen her work with it because what you have with this book is demons entire literal life story for me personally there were a few times where i asked myself do i really need all this and there were times where demon seemed to relive versions of the same kind of experience i felt like okay ive seen this once and it was powerful enough that i think we can move oni also took a star because as much as i loved all these characters sometimes they crowded the stage sometimes thered be characters in a scene or an arc who i didnt think needed to be there i completely understood barbaras desire to make lee county one of those places where you keep coming back and you keep running into people you knew and they in turn touch your life again it happens i should know but truth is stranger than fiction and in fiction all these people popping in and out just cramps the books style some characters like tommy and fast forward it works for others its like okay move alongperhaps this is why i thought a few threads werent developed at the pace they shouldve been for instance fast forward is a monster and im totally behind that and you do see hints of his true character throughout the novel like at creaky farm but hes in and out of the story so much that the actual revelation of how deep fast forwards problems gowell it works but it also feels a bit out of left field the same is true for betsys thread in that yeah i buy demon having a grandma he doesnt meet until hes twelve and i buy her not wanting to be in his life but then as angus says her desire to basically take over makes no sensefinally yes i did take off points for language thats not because i cant handle it im an adult for goodness sakes but the nearconstant fbombs just got on my nerves after a while because just really and as you might know the misuse of jesus name is a very personal pet peeve now im sure jesus himself had to tell his disciples to clean up their language now and again especially peter and its my personal theory that our beloved st paul had a potty mouth at least to a point but it does wear on you so not a major issue for adult readers but if its not your thing caveat emptor and yeah id say dont give this one to your teen its got some pretty heavy depictions of addiction in it as well as a couple of sex scenes i freely admit i skimmedall that aside though i dont regret spending a minute with demon copperhead he is a perfect modern david copperfield he got me thinking and in a weird way yeah the book blessed me it inspired me to keep writing and im willing to bet it

demon copperhead a pulitzer prize winner,a deeply truthful fiction,5,the similarity of this title to dickenss david copperfield is no accident though the books are very little alike kingsolver cheerfully admits that she owes dickens for inspiration the theme is much the same institutionalized poverty and the terrible effects it has on children in particularlike his sortof model demon his real name is damon fields but almost everyone in this book goes by a nickname of one sort or another narrates his own tale and begins with his birth in the caul as he says the amniotic sac emerged undamaged with him in it while his mother lay unconscious from the chemicals in her bloodstream on the floor of her singlewide that he survived is due to her neighbor and landlady mrs peggot who checked up on the mother on her way to church ahe had her husband call an ambulance no fathers name appeared on demons birth certificate mother knew who the father was but he had drowned at a place called the devils bathtubthis all takes place i should say in lee county in the southwestern part of virginia appalachian coal country demons mom when she isnt on a bender or in rehab works at the local walmart stocking seasonal items and telling customers where to find things he himself grows up more or less wild alongside his friend maggot mrs peggots grandson who is with her because maggots mom is in prison for carving up her abusive boyfriend mr and mrs peggot do a lot to help demon out and they provide a sort of extended family for himdemons youth ends abruptly when murrell stoner stoner arrives woos the mother and ultimately moves into the trailer he is as abusive as maggots father and at one point locks demon into his room for multiple days his behavior drives mom back onto drugs she has been collecting chips for a while now she turns up unconscious and demon who by now has not eaten or been to the bathroom in several days rides with her in the ambulance dss the local version of child protective services comes along and places demon at a farmfoster home run by crickson an old widower who works the boys hard tending the cattle and harvesting the tobaccoand as you might expect things go downhill from there eventually demon has a brief period of happiness and glory when running away from another foster home run by mr and mrs mccobb he finds his paternal grandmother betsy woodall she and her chairbound brother dick see to it that demon is placed in with coach winfield who trains him up to play football he quickly becomes a star in the high school football team until a knee is very badly brokenthis begins demons dependence on oxycontin and other drugs which by now have become a major theme of the booklets go no further with summary let us rather consider the thematics of demon copperheadas noted kingsolver explicitly states that her primary theme is the effects of institutionalized poverty especially on children demon muses about the poverty trap at some length throughout the book at one point a teacher gives a short lecture on the ongoing war of the haves on the havenots my term not his he goes into detail about how the coal company ruined the land economy of lee county and ate up its men until machines took over and most of the men were suddenly unemployedthe drug companies and especially purdue named explicitly by june peggott another daughter of mrs peggott a nurse who gives occasional lectures on how opioids and especially oxycontin have further destroyed the folk of lee county one of the more hellish locales in demon copperhead is a pain clinic run by a doctor who for a fee of one sort or another happily writes whatever prescription the patient asks forone of demons friends tommy waddell brings in a third variation on the theme he describes how american culture has made hillbillies a laughingstock a living punchline and a lesser class of human being from the beverly hillbillies and its kin to deliverance and beyond he and demon whom i have not mentioned is an extremely talented artist create a comic strip about an appalachian superhero the red neck and it runs weekly in the local newspaper where tommy by this point is workingit is pretty clear that one of the purposes of this book is to provide a counterweight to the hillbilly image while staying true to the characters and communities it depicts lee county is real the small towns named in the book are not nor of course are the specific charactersursula k le guin wrote that fiction writers tell the truth by lying demon copperfield tells a whole lot of powerful truth in much the manner of dickens kingsolver makes you care not only about demon but about much of his supporting cast excepting the genuinely villainous ones like stoner while recognizing their flawsthis is in short one incredible book,positive
demon copperhead a pulitzer prize winner,more than a dickens rewrite,5,when at the age of i first read david copperfield charles dickens classic novel of the protagonists struggle to rise above child poverty in a society seemingly structured to keep him poor it was the first book that made me tear up at the end that glorious end with the angelic agnes ever pointing upward i wasnt sure that barbara kingsolvers demoncopperhead could possibly elicit anything like that response from my jaded seenitallbefore readitallbefore consciousness reimagining the quintessentially british dickens nineteenthcentury story as a twentyfirst century slice of american appalachian life hows that likely to workwell of course it was likely to bomb spectacularly but instead what i found from the books very first paragraph was a voice that explodes off the page with both confidence and worldweariness with stoicism and selfknowledge with everything the character is going to exhibit in the rest of this blockbuster of a noveldickens david famously opens with whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show by contrast kingsolvers copperhead whose real name is damon fields but he has red hair so opens with first i got myself born a decent crowd was on hand to watch and theyve always given me that much the worst of the job was up to me my mother being lets just say out of itin this life you make your own choices and if youre going to get anywhere and your mother is in and out of rehab constantly you have to do it yourself damon tells you at the beginning you think theres going to be a hero in your life think again theres just you trying to make your way in a world thats stacked against you heres a voice that in its tone of genuine downhome rural americanism sounds a lot more like huck finn than anybody in dickens like huck he has a memorable way of putting things in his colorful american vernacular hes the eagle scout of trailer trash he tells us at one pointand i dont mean to say that you must be familiar with david copperfield to enjoy demon copperhead you can follow the plot empathize with the characters and absorb the themes of kingsolvers book without ever having heard of dickens but it does add something to the overall experience of the book if you know the copperfield story in particular theres a bit of fun for readers when they can recognize by name a kingsolvian character intended to parallel a dickensian one thus when damons abusive stepfather bears the name of stoner its easy to see the connection with davids equally cruel stepfather whose name happens to be murdstone damons kind neighbors the peggots clearly recall davids friends the peggottys and clara peggoty davids early nurse and lifelong friend dickens charming and narcissistic james steerforth who for a while promises to be that hero of my own life david looks forward to in his opening sentence finds his counterpoint in kingsolvers sterling ford nicknamed fast forward star quarterback on the high school football team and for awhile damons idol copperfields child wife dora spenlowe is echoed in kingsolvers dori and when damon falls for his needy childish dori you dont have to remember david copperfield to know that relationship is going to be a disaster but it helpsoccasionally kingsolvers parallel characters are direct mirror images of dickens as in the case of damons grandmother betsy and her eccentric friend mr dick who liked flying kites mirroring davids greataunt betsy and her eccentric friend mr dick who also liked flying kites sometimes theres more of a difference damons shortterm foster father mr mccobb has a few things in common with davids mr micawber lack of steady employment and perpetual new schemes to get rich among them but micawber is a wellmeaning screwup while mccobb is just trying to take advantage of the system and dickens uriah heep is a far more insidious villain than kingsolvers assistant coach uhaul pyles whose downfall is far less precipitous than heeps in dickens and then there is angus winfield daughter of the high school football coach and damons fostersister during the best and worst years of his life who clearly parallels davids guardian angel agnes wickfield and who you know from the first is going to be a major influence in damons lifeof course knowing dickens gives you an idea of the role these characters are going to play in the story but the plot of demon copperhead is not therefore predictable as kingsolver translates these characters motivations and effects on the protagonist into a completely different milieu of time and place ultimately whats important about the influence of dickens on kingsolvers book is not the superficial correspondences of plot or character but rather their very significant agreement in terms of theme and authorial intent in an afterword to her novel kingsolver writes im grateful to charles dickens for writing david copperfield his impassioned critique of institutional poverty and its damaging effects on children in his society those problems are still with us in adapting his novel to my own place and time working for years with his outrage inventiveness and empathy at my elbow ive come to think of him as my genius friendit is precisely those social evils that kingsolver has directly in her sites in this novel the institutional poverty of former coalmining areas of her native appalachia the effects of that poverty on children especially children whose parents have been victims of that poverty and are dead or imprisoned she attacks the ineptitude and bureaucracy of child welfare services the abuse of the system of foster care that allows people like damons foster parents to take children solely for the sake of taking the monthly support money or for gaining slave labor like the tobacco farmer who first fosters damon she attacks a justice system that will accept the testimony of an abusive stepfather rather than the word of the abused childbut more than anything else she attacks the opioid crisis damon who has a brief period when it seems he may escape the cesspool of his luckless life through success on the gridiron as a high school football star has a terrible knee injury for which he is prescribed opioid pain relievers to which he becomes hopelessly addicted and kingsolvers indictment of the doctors salesmen druggists and especially the sacklerowned purdue pharma are is merciless in the novel it truly seems like there is no way out for damonbut as david copperfield had a talent in writing that finally helped pull him out of poverty the fact that damon has a talent for drawingall he has left after footballdoes give him a ray of hope i wont spoil the end by telling you whether hes able to use itthus kingsolver is not simply the heir of dickens in recasting his most personal novel she is more importantly the spiritual heir of dickens novel of social criticism something you dont see much of any more where is dickens today where are the zolas the sinclair lewises the john steinbecks gone but weve still got barbara kingsolver,positive

remarkably bright creatures a read with jenna pick,an octagonal delight that showcases love loss and learning from animals,5,i seldom read fiction as i read nonfiction voraciously to prepare for my weekly podcast as i love octopuses thanks to seeing the documentary my octopus teacher times someone recommended this book to me it was an absolute delight shelbys writing is enchanting she delivers the beautiful nuance of language among different dialects of english speakers which just draws you in big time and the story is deliciously elevating and heartwarming she shows us the beautifully interconnected world we all live in but seldom take time or effort to glimpse or truly appreciate i cant wait for her next novel,positive
remarkably bright creatures a read with jenna pick,a wonderful start,4,i am besotted with the octopus besotted this firsttime novelist presents a marvelously erudite creature narrating how much he knows and i must confess that his knowings really melted my heart like my dog does always devotedly attending and perfectly albeit without a word for me this story amplifies my wonder at how seamlessly nonhuman nature can communicate with us offering incredible kinds of conversation even from inside a tank at a marinelife aquariummarcellus the octopus is always ruminating about what he hears from people passing through the tank exhibits saying things like ignorance is bliss to this particular expression marcellus objects because he says here in the kingdom of animals ignorance is dangerous the poor herring dropped into the tank lacks any awareness of the shark lurking below ask the herring whether what he doesnt know can hurt him this contemplation becomes compassion when the octopus notes that humans can be wounded by their own oblivion too they do not see it but i do it happens all the time humans walk alike or in this case unalike far more than they realizethe human characters in this aquarium couldnt see what marcellus could until they could thanks largely to assistance from a literal sucker for injured creatures creatures like himself creatures captured in the ticking of time with lifespans that are getting shorter every dayspoiler alert they all get freed in the end,positive
remarkably bright creatures a read with jenna pick,a great read,5,this book was so good the stories about each or the characters including marcellus the octopus are so wonderfully intertwined that you cant stop readingyou cant wait to find out whats next in each of their lives while the portrayal of the octopus seems beyond what he could possibly see and do it forced me to do some research about the ability of giant octopi to accomplish some of the things that marcellus didyes there are examples of these creatures accomplishing what he does obviously no one actually can verify what they think but these creatures have been observed doing many of the things that he does in the book the best part of the way the book is written is that all of the characters are developed well and their lives while they seem to be totally separate one not truly influencing the others are slowly intertwined as the book continuesobviously i loved the book and found it hard to put down i called one of my daughters to tell them that i had a wonderful suggestion for her next read she is a working mother with kids who keep her busy a lot of the time she told me she had one for me also it turned out that she recommended remarkably bright creatures to me just as i was about to do the same to her the discussion that my book club had of the book reached the same conclusiondont miss this book and we wondered what the next book from ms peck would be,positive
remarkably bright creatures a read with jenna pick,best of the year,5,remarkably bright creatures by shelby van pelt starts with an animal as a main character and if you have seen the shape of water your first fear is a recreation of that quirky top twist we alternate chapters between tova an aquarium custodian and an octopus because we accept this as a work of fiction we go along despite our doubts about which aquarium dwellers would have the best mind for crimesolving and why van pelt chose the eightlegged onecameron a third character has a bad breakup and loses his job now we have three lives that need to intersect and it does not take long for you to care about them tovas misanthropic characteristics somehow make her more intriguing the incident when all three of these remarkably different characters come together happens early in the novel but still qualifies as an aha moment each is a bright creature in its way and they will surprise youan octopus as an omniscient narrator sounds like a hokey idea but van pelt makes it work as the winner of bookbrowses best debut it is unique and not surprisingly like nothing you have read van pelt most likely has a few more stories in her i read a few reviews that stated how horrible of a human being cameron is but that shows you how skilled van pelt is loveable idiots are hard to produce so i credit the author she also creates chapter titles that mean nothing until you read a tactic that works like the frasier tv showpredicting endings or twists is not my skill set but i saw this coming it did not take away from my enjoyment since the characters meant so much to me then how would the average person respond in the face of so much loss tova leads the novel as a woman who goes about her business in life because what else can she do marcellus the giant pacific octopus has the advantage of knowing everything as a literary device in which we see the tragedy behind the characters ignoranceit is too early to predict that this will be the best of the year and i cannot see anything passing up this and in love the story arc travels at the right pace and i did not want to put it down all three main characters had nothing in common with me but i still related to them when everything starts coming together and you see the finish line you cannot help but feel relief and pity simultaneously you took this journey with all three of them and hoped for closure,positive

remarkably bright creatures a read with jenna pick,super sweet story,5,remarkably bright creatures is such a sweet story i enjoy books with storylines that seem completely separate that end up coming together in the end very much so of course i loved this one having some chapters narrated by the octopus is an added bit of fun plus it makes it so you the reader know things before the characters another thing i enjoy in books i highly recommend this book to adults who enjoy a feel good story,positive

harry potter paperback box set books,an important part of my childhood which i still love over years later,5,ive been a fan of harry potter since about the grade school back when the only books that had been published yet were the first three when potters popularity was still on the rise when christian fundamentalists were still catching on to the horrifying idea that a witchcraft story was gaining popularity with children and gradeschool teachers were similarly catching on to harry potter being a pretty effective tool for getting kids to develop a liking for books indeed that was how i discovered them my english teacher somewhere in the thtothgrade portion of schooling where my catholic school shifted to a highschoollike classroom and teacher shuffle to prepare students for the routines public school would involve introduced me and several other students who were showing less interest and enthusiasm in the class to the harry potter novels actually lending us her own copies of the first three books to get us reading by the time the much thicker fourth volume goblet of fire came out i was so in love in the series that its intimidating size was far more appealing to me than intimidating like a larger bowl of rocky road ice cream might look appealingin the decadeandahalf since ive never let go of my love of harry potter even if i have gone long stretches of time without keeping an active eye on the franchise the recent revival of widespread potter interest of the appealingbutflawed sequel stage play harry potter and the cursed child and an arguablymoreinterestingand consistentlyengrossing prequelsidestorymovie fantastic beasts and where to find them has prompted me to revisit the book series yet again as well as replace my old worndown hardcover copies with both the paperback box set and the ebook downloads from pottermores eshop which are crosscompatible with kindle accounts and can be transferred over as identical files to the kindle versions by the way even though amazon doesnt count those files as purchases of the kindle ebooks but rather as separate accountexclusive items having checked on audible this series does not seem to be compatible with whispersync for voice no matter where you buy the ebooks as of yet so audiobook fans who like to read the text while listening may wish to take note of that when deciding whether to buy a physical or ebook versions this is possibly due to revisions having been made to the text for series consistency in the time since the audiobooks were recordedindepth reviews of the individual books are perhaps best saved for each books individual page on amazon so i will give only a broadstroke review of the stories here if you are considering buying the series as a complete box set its likely youve already read and enjoyed at least the one of the books but for the uninitiated harry potter is a series that follows a boy harry himself across a sevenyear series of adventures culminating in the return and subsequent war against lord voldemort a terrible dark wizard who wreaked horrors upon the magical and nonmagical communities alike until his unexpected and inexplicable destruction when he killed harrys parents and then attempted to kill harry while he was still an infant harry growing up with his nonmagical muggle aunt and uncle who cruelly neglect and emotionally abuse him receives a letter of acceptance to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry when he turns eleven whereupon he discovers that not only is there a burgeoning community of witches and wizards living and hiding in plain sight in a seeminglyordinary s british society but that he is famous among the magical community they call him the boy who lived the cause of voldemorts disappearance and the end of his reign of terror but as harry enters the magical world and begins to learn about this new side of his life and the wonders of magic he gets drawn into a series of perilous events that lead him closer and closer to his eventual destiny with each passing book gradually revealing more of the truth behind what happened on the night harrys parents were murdered and what led to it among other thingsharry potter is a fantastic series one might be tempted to think its overblown or overrated by its enthusiasts one would in fact be forgiven for taking that impression almost exclusively from the movies theyre enjoyable enough in their own right but suffer problems of lessthanamazing adaptation and fluctuations in creative vision that make the film series feel somewhat disjointed and lessthoughtful than the books theyre based on and have the added problem of the younger actors and actresses often taking a few films to develop the skills to portray their characters naturally an occupational hazard of a fantasy epic that relies on child actors really the harry potter novels meanwhile provide an arguably smoother introduction and subsequently a more fleshedout experience in harrys world with the earlier shorter books providing a comfortable and more episodic early portion thats great for allowing readers to get their feet wet becoming gradually more involved and complex until the buildup culminates with the fourth and fifth novels where the story goes allin on characterization and worldbuilding detail presuming the writer to be fully invested by that point and keeping that level of maturity and intensity right up to the ending of the final volumeit would be remiss of me to call this series perfect dont mistake the fivestar rating for that jk rowling certainly has her weaknesses as a writer and it could be accurately said that the novels suffer from a bit of a bloating problem that surfaced around book five where rowling clearly had more power to say no to her editors incidentally this is also the point at which the american text just gives up at hiding away a lot of the britishisms in narration and dialogue and i will say the books are at least better for that much this is a clear your mileage may vary kind of point i personally enjoy the tangential worldbuilding that comes out of it and consider it worth whatever bloat occurs as a result but then harry potter and the order of the phoenix is my favorite of the seven novels and even for some avowed fans of harry potter that book was too long and spent a little too much time on certain things theres really no way to tell whether that will be a problem for you until you get there and either like it or dont like it but what problems the potter novels have are in the grand scheme just niggles it all comes together in a really great way and in spite of the flaws its a really great series of books worthy of the classification of epicbut one thing that might surprise people unfamiliar with potter is that this is not a fantasy actionadventure series its more of a mystery series coated in a gooey chocolate fantasy syrup harry potter himself tends to fill the role of a combination frodo baggins figure and upandcoming detective character and the most important plot points are regardless of who figures out or explains a given part of things presented as mysteries action sequences occur and can be quite intense particularly in later volumes but this is not the story of a big supercool hero slaying dragons its a story of circumstance figuring out the circumstance and then reacting to the circumstance some readers seem annoyed by the fact that elevenyearold harry never matures in this series to a point where by the end of magical high school hes capable of going headtohead in a duel with a dark lord with decades of extensive magical knowledge under his belt but that is simply not the angle that this series goes for my comparison of harry to frodo baggins was not an idlenamedrop harrys role in this story is very deliberately that of the hero who stands strong against adversity but ultimately triumphs through lowkey action behind the scenes of a conflict in which number other more powerful or more experienced combatants command the bulk of the dark lords attention and like frodo and his progenitor bilbo sometimes harry is helped by sheer circumstance the timely and skillful intervention of one of his friends or a combination of his own efforts plus those things the series does give us a fairly clear picture of what an actioncentric lead character in this universe might look like and i think thats where a fair portion of reader disappointment with harrys more subdued take on heroics comes from but he is an elevenyearold who eventually becomes a seventeenyearold over the course of the story contending with a villain who has fiftyplusyear lead on experience over him i think i would have raised an eyebrow had harry ever bested voldemort in a straightup magical fightas with everything this series is something you should read for yourself if youre unsure theres probably a copy available at your local library if you dont live in a particularly strict area with a stick up its rear about fantasy novels with magic in them i recommend giving them a shot and if book one doesnt jive with you at first sticking with it at least until the end of book two this is a series that improves as it moves forward each book adding new layers to the existing world by pacing its narrative in the same way a child might learn more and more about the real world as he or she grows into an adult which is a large part of harry potters effectiveness as a comingofage story the reader in a figurative sense grows with harry as many of the original readers grew with harry alongside the release of each subsequent book this is as much a narrative tool as a consequence of readers aging as they read the books because with very rare exceptions scattered through the series the narrative is locked firmly into whatever it is that harry potter himself is seeing hearing saying feeling or thinking and the readers understanding of events and the world around him is often limited to what he knows or notices at any given timeas for the separate editions of these books i cant voice for the complete collection ebook specifically since i bought the ebooks individually on pottermore but assuming the formatting for the complete collection is identical then the digital set relevant to this review is wellputtogether and smoothly formatted just about the best way youll ever experience harry potter digitally without buying the ibooksandiosexclusive enhanced edition ebooks available on pottermore which feature animated illustrations and the like if you have an ipad or iphone that is the edition i recommend for digital consumption but for standard kindle and android users or people who like reading ebooks on pc this collection and its individualebook versions arent inferior to physical books in any sense other than not having a special font for chapter headings the us editions of the ebooks even contain the iconic chapter title illustrations although not the original american cover art the minimalist cover art of the ebooks makes for a smoother transition between colored screens and blackandwhite ereaders thoughthe hardcover collection is one that i cant vouch for as a set but having owned and read through the series in hardcover in the past what i can vouch for is that the american hardcover editions are very nice to own the box set for hardcover may lack the text revision of the ebooks and more recent paperback printings however and while the chapter artwork and font for titles is something i prefer over the uk editions it should be acknowledged that the american hardcovers are of a slightly cheaper construction than the uk editions although also paradoxically they have a higher page count due to scholastics formatting choices there are fewer words per page compared to the uk versions and order of the phoenix has the formatting oddity of being the only book in the series with narrower margins and linespacing due to its much higher word count having researched this set it should be acknowledged that the trunk is made of cardboard so dont expect you know an extremely durable box or anything its just a stylized container for a box setas for the paperback box set the purchase that prompted this review its fantastic the american version with the characters riding a dragon specifically im seeing a lot of user pictures in this review second for completely different sets and it seems theres a motley assortment of mixed sets in the marketplace listings too the box itself is quite sturdy and adorned with beautiful artwork by the cover illustrator mary grandpr depicting a scene from later in the series that puts me in the mind of the old ra salvatore cleric quintet omnibus cover art which features a similar scene by what i assume is coincidence the paperback volumes themselves are of a nice quality that makes them both more durable and less stifffeeling than some smaller cheaper massmarket paperbacks and they even feature raised lettering for the front cover titling although the paper and print quality are noticeably lesser than the hardcover editions feeling at a casual touch like the pages would be easier to damage both by bending and by splashing a few drops of a drink in the books general direction not up to the quality of some of the bettermade paperback novels that i own even so these are paperbacks that should be taken care of and kept for posterity rather than tossed about like a cheapy grocery store throwaway novel that you picked up on a whim during a foodshopping trip though the thickness of books four through seven may make it difficult to avoid bending the spineshaving checked certain passages in the books i can also confirm that the paperback boxed set bought new should contained the revised editions of the text as well for as minor as those changes are to the overall experience again theyre really just consistency tweaks,positive
harry potter paperback box set books,great series seems to be random what covers you get,5,so leading off with i got this on sale for an amazing priceim a little confused why i got the version i did as nothing in the ordering process said thats what it would be and it doesnt match the image shown that being said i like the covers geared towards children more anyways as the adult ones are boring i love the version i got images others have shared have been different versions if the version matters to you order elsewhere if not then this is a great place to order from the version is only a cover art matter i believeoverall its a great series that i will recommend to anyone who loves magic and adventure and tales of friendship,positive
harry potter paperback box set books,fantastic books that everyone should read,5,i put off reading the harry potter series for so so long as i thought it would be too juvenile i didnt see the movies either i love fantasy fiction but im more apt to read the works of terry goodkind or terry brooks as opposed to books intended for young adults i am incredibly glad that i gave the harry potter series a chance while the first couple of books are definitely geared towards young adult readers the world the characters and the story that rowling creates are all so fascinating and fun that it really doesnt matter im currently reading the series a nd time and im enjoying them even more than i did the st time these books are absolutely timeless classics and are among my alltime favorite booksive seen all the movies now after reading the books the movies were just fine but the books are so much better if youve seen the movies and liked them but didnt read the books youre missing so much amazing content that truly makes the wizarding world as magical as it isthe hardcover books make for a wonderful collectors set i didnt really care about the case they came in as i prefer to display them on a bookshelf with the rest of my hardcover books,positive
harry potter paperback box set books,loved the stories but now im suffering potter withdrawal,5,harry potter and the philosophers stonei had to research a few briticisms throughout this book but they didnt seriously interrupt the story flow what did interrupt were the numerous comma splices they forced me to reread many sentences having said that i enjoyed the plot and character development i never felt boredif amazon had half stars id give harry potter and the philosophers stone since that isnt possible ill award it a harry potter and the chamber of secretsmystery humorand a smidgeon of possible romancethe plusses rowling steers harry potter through a mystery with a surprise outcome sprinkling the tale with tidbits of humor when i reached the end i wanted to keep reading and find out how harry spent his summer with his horrible relativesminuses numerous comma splices drew me out of the story forcing me to reread sentencesa solid out of stars id award an extra stars if it werent

suspenseful mini mysteries throughout the novel astute readers might be able to spot clues that will help them see what happens next hint pay attention to every detail the old characters make appearances as well as a few new ones including an unexpected friend for harryas usual i enjoyed the ending and cant wait to read the next in the seriesrowlings comma splices occur far less frequently in this book which increased my reading enjoyment immensely i cant resistfive stars harry potter and the goblet of firethe best yet with intrigue laughs and tearsthis book reads like a spy novel i couldnt decipher the good guys and the bad guys and just when i decided someone was one or the other i discovered i was wrong rowling finally reveals how to pronounce hermione hermyohnee due to a clever conversation where hermione teaches krum how to say her name properlynear the end one of the characters explains how and why many past events occurred i found it a tad like an infodump runon sentences occur far less in goblet than in prisoner and mostly in dialogue which assists comprehensionnow i wonder how harrys summer with the dursleys will go his summers always intrigue and amuse menote to parents one of the chapters thirtytwo i believe contains violent scenes that wouldnt be suitable for young childrenanother fivestar read harry potter and the order of the phoenixwith every novel in the harry potter series i find myself becoming more engaged and wanting to read just one more chapter before closing my kindlein phoenix harrys character develops as he grows into a typical angstridden teenagerwith more reason for angst than most of his peers rowling increases the romance factor and introduces a character so vile that i disliked her from her first appearance in the novel a couple of secrets are revealed including the reason why harry must spend summers with the dursleys and an intriguing clue surfaces that i suspect will play an important part in halfblood princerowling provides enough backstory so that firsttime potter readers will understand the story and the runon sentences become fewer with each novelfive stars harry potter and the halfblood princemy optimism about a clue that was revealed in order of the phoenix didnt prove correct sighin halfblood prince dumbledores pensieve acts as a marvelous link to backstory that doesnt seem like backstory more information about voldemort appears via harrys regular meetings with dumbledore we are kept guessing throughout most of the novel and perhaps will be wrong about snapes true intentionsalthough rowling doesnt kill people off with the alacrity of george r r martin she does dispense with another beloved character the funeral chapter is wellwritten evincing tears and a chuckle or twoi wonder whether harry will carry through with his plans is he really who he and everyone else thinks he is or now i cant wait to tackle deathly hallowsfive stars harry potter and the deathly hallowsi withdraw my comment about rowlings propensity for killing off characters however their demises were necessary in deathly hallows otherwise the story wouldnt ring true rowlings masterful manipulation of emotions had me smiling nay laughing in some areasand tearing up in otherswithout providing any spoilers i wondered throughout why the photo of a key headmaster didnt give harry any advice plot hole in previous novels as well as this one misleading clues were dropped some were essential others frustrated me because they didnt amount to anythingnote to firsttime readers pay careful attention to clues you might be able to predict a few twists if you dofive stars general commentsms rowlings style did change somewhat as the novels progressed annoying runon sentences appeared less with each novelnow im suffering potter withdrawal will we ever see stories about the children of key wizards and witches no not screenplays written by others but novels written by the author herself i would read themfive stars for this reading experience ms rowling and good luck with future writing endeavors,positive

of lively characters outrageous banter and lots of steamy chemistry there are adorable pets and kids that steal your heart there is also a dose of danger brewing in the background geographically it likely matches up with either reallife western loudoun or clarke county virginia although the town is vibrant and attracts visitors from nearby washington dc knockemout retains its sense of history and a strong feeling of community it is rumored that the town was named to reflect the way its citizens have long worked out their problems the good oldfashioned way they fight it out and move on the

had lived in knockemout she had managed to build herself quite a reputation and as an identical twin naomi soon finds herself reaping the results she doesnt find many friendly facesnaomi doesnt find her sister but she does end up as tinas latest victim after having lived through the worst day of her life the next day isnt looking much better stuck without a phone car or credit card she is dependent upon the kindness of others yet nothing could have prepared her for the discovery that tina had left behind an elevenyearold daughter a niece naomi never knew existed doing right by her is never a question waylay is tough like her mother but behind the hard exterior might just be a preteen desperate for some normalcy she is whipsmart but guarded and naomi knows that earning waylays trust will be a huge challengenaomi is stuck in knockemout for at least six months while the custodial arrangement works its way through the legal system her entire world pivots as her sense of control is challenged all of her plans for the future are in upheaval leaving her adrift with uncertainty as the locals begin to know naomi as not tina she begins to settle in however there is one particular grumpy viking of a man that drives her crazy and sets her body on fire at the same time he is rude and infuriating and his badboy vibe is completely the opposite of warners almost from the time she rode into town this man has put himself in the middle of her business but the last thing she needs with waylays custody in limbo is troubleknox morgan fortythree is his own man his good looks beard and tattoos give him the quintessential badboy vibe so women love him in spite of his prickly personality he does what he wants when he wants and he wouldnt have it any other way rules are for people like his brother nash knockemouts chief of police they have a long history of fighting but they always made up too that changed about three years ago and things havent been the same between them since it breaks their grandmothers heart she raised the boys after their mother died and now whats left of their family is in shamblesknox knows good things never last so anything more than a casual relationship has never been on the table for him he doesnt like strings and he moves on at the first sign of an attachment he hasnt been with a local girl since high school to the disappointment of many when he is in the mood for a good chase he heads out of town for a night or two of fun and pleasure the routine has grown tiresome though which might explain his irresistible attraction to a certain newcomer little miss daisies in her hair is not his type at all she is uppity and needy and her vocabulary is too big he hates that he wants her so badly but if he cannot have her nobody can his brother nash in particularknox came into money a few years back but he didnt take it for granted he has carefully managed his growing portfolio of local businesses increasing his net worth he coowns whiskey clipper with his longtime good friend jeremiah whose vision has paid off big time the old barber shop was transformed into a salon that now draws clientele from dc a proud barber people go out of their way to sit in knoxs chair he spends most of his time doing managerial work for his various businesses though when his business manager sherry fiasco hires naomi behind his back he realizes that he is in deep trouble the last thing he needs every day is to see naomi waitressing at honky tonk his barknox and naomi have instant chemistry but things get off to bad start when he confuses her with her delinquent sister naomi doesnt appreciate being yelled at and she is tired of always playing nice despite his intimidating presence she pushes back catching knox and everyone around him off guard their crazy banter soon becomes entertainment for the locals denying their attraction to one another eventually proves to be harder than giving in to temptation knox is stubbornly stuck in his ways and naomi is just trying to get by they agree that whatever they have is a temporary tryst but then things get complicated neither is ready for a relationship things move quickly in their rocky ride but they eventually earn their happy endingdont forget to download the free bonus epilogue via the link at the back of the bookbook two things we hide from the light follows in which knoxs brother nash gets his happy ending with lina they meet here in book onebook three things we left behind also gets a brief preview here as lucian and sloanes backstory is hinted atwow knox and naomis story is a fabulous read the characters and their trendy northern virginia town come to life in vivid detail and spectacular dialogue their story really sticks with you and youll quickly be reaching for book two so that you can continue to immerse yourself in the knockemout world there were eleven laughoutloud moments by my count as well as countless witty excerpts scattered throughout i also came across eight teary scenes the couples chemistry drips off the page tooknox and naomi are opposites in so many ways knox is gruff and intimidating while naomi is kind and wellmannered knox wears tattoos and doesnt always stay within the law while naomi wears sundresses and always follows the rules knox pushes people away whereas people are naturally drawn to naomi despite first appearances however they actually do have a lot in common knox may keep people at a distance but he is all about giving back he loves his town his employees his friends and his family even if he doesnt know how to express it his intentions are easily misconstrued since he is generally so unpleasant naomis selfless personality is more obvious which makes her a prime target for manipulation their shared concern for waylays welfare gives them a distraction from their incessant arguing it gives them an opening that might not have occurred otherwise because knoxs general grouchiness sets the otherwise pleasant daisy off he triggers something wild and untamed in her an attribute she abhorsthere are a few issues that merit mention first there are some timeline issues there is some inconsistency and vagueness that occasionally causes confusion i looked back several times to verify but had to make assumptions of my own my takeaway is that the story opened about weeks prior to the first day of school which would be early august and the story runs its course by october the bonus epilogue gives a quick peek at the couple with their family and friends five years down the road second knoxs relationships are supposedly shortlived and casual but later there are a few statements that make it sound as if he has had a history of actual relationships implying something more than casual hookups when in fact he always walks away before it gets that far third there is a point at which i couldnt understand why naomi hadnt moved she had the funds and it would have been appropriate given developments fourth linas nearly twodecade friendship with knox postbreakup didnt feel credible to me i would have expected her to lose interest at some point and stop making the effort further the fact that she never met nash in almost twenty years of friendship is not at all credible nash and knox have a history of fighting but it is only the last three years that theyve not been able to make up that lina walks into knoxs establishment like it is nothing shows knox has actually brought his outoftown girlfriends home or at the very least he has hung out with lina in his hometown in a town that thrives on gossip that friendship would have been rumored to be more and it would have gotten back to nash without a doubt he would have made it his business to meet her finally i was surprised at naomis outreach to tina after so much concern about safety had been voiced it was used to further the plot but it made naomi look thoughtlessknox and naomis riotous romance will have you in stitches but dont forget the tissues fans of nicole snow will love the witty humor and writing style here coffee lovers will delight and dog lovers will drool in this darling story naomi is a runaway bride who finds herself heated once tattooed viking knox starts yelling and telling her what to do their enemiestolovers onenightstand transforms into a fake relationship once things get complicated the story is smartly written it is a pageturner from the start although it does slow down a bit in the second half the plot is fairly simple knockemout comes to life in this story the characters are wonderfully defined and the couples romantic tension is palpable there is a large cast of colorful and unique characters the story is told in first person the pov alternates between knox and naomi i rate this book stars,positive
things we never got over knockemout,grumpy ml strong female lead romance heartfelt more,5,grumpy man who is unable to stop thinking about woman said womans life turning upside down after her twin sister stole her money car and then found out she had an eleven year old niece talk about a lot going on for naomi witt this story had everything i could possibly want and more from the grumpiness of knox naomi trying to figure out the whirlwind mess that became her life and somehow in the mist of all the drama love found a way and there were some added heartfelt moments as well as funny moments tooright from the start naomi had just come out of a big mess but just when she thought things couldnt get any worse her twin sister tina stole all of naomis things and left her to care for her niece waylay who she didnt even know existed add into the mix the ever so grumpy and tough knox who seemed to not only make naomi angry but frustrated both mentally and physically wink wink knox seemed annoyed yet somehow fascinated by naomi from the way she carried herself to low key checking out her facebook to see everything about her to having some spicy dreams about naomi that left him wanting her in ways he had never felt before not to mention knox downright telling naomi to her face that she wasnt his type haha very funny knox because based off the way he acted towards her throughout the story would seem otherwise so you could only imagine the tension that occurred between naomi and knox was both a pleasure and entertaining to watch unfoldi loved seeing naomi adapt to the new changes in her life aka trying to care of waylay and trying to be the best guardian she could be for her especially since tina waylays mom never cared for her and treated her badly naomi wasnt the only one who cared for waylay but also knox nash liza j and naomis parents and the whole town of knockemout having those people rally around waylay and provide her with both love and support was so heartwarming to see plus you could tell that waylay appreciated having that sense of true family around her since she never really had that to begin with naomi struggled in the beginning trying to grapple with ways to connect with waylay and provide her with all the necessities she could possibly need and want thankfully with the residential grumpy man that was knox he definitely went above and beyond to help naomi with waylaythrough the drama that came with tina and trying to make sure waylay was taken care of naomi had a lot on her plate but somehow during all of it she caught the eye of knox what i found so amusing with knox was that he was aware that he was grumpy and cough a bit rude to naomi but what also made me laugh was that he would sometimes complain about constantly thinking about naomi or felt kind of annoyed having to pull her out of trouble in all honesty though knox wanted to help out naomi because he genuinely wanted to be there for her if anything knox wasnt use to the feelings that naomi brought out in him and therefore resorted to being his grumpy self and blamed his bodys reaction to only wanting naomi in a purely physical way haha joke was on knox because based off the chemistry he and naomi had their connection went beyond just physical while i will say the passion between those two was amazing especially reading it the spice the dirty talk and pure wanting lust between was whoa and of course we cant forget how demanding and possessive knox was over naomiin addition i loved how knox became sort of naomis unofficial yet official caretaker provider in a way naomi was so use to taking care of everyone from always cleaning up tinas messes to literally doing everything for ex in her previous relationship naomi did it all knox saw that naomi always put others needs before her own and he wanted to be the one to take care of naomi something in the pit of knoxs gut just had this natural instinct of protection over naomi wanted to be her herothis story was absolutely amazing i loved that with each chapter i was drawn in more by the characters the plot and the overall feeling i got while reading i couldnt put this book down and if i wasnt reading it i was thinking about it constantly i especially loved the tight knit community that was in knockemout how everyone helped one another came together as a community and the overall support everyone provided for naomi and waylay this story captured my heart naomi and knox definitely had some bumps in the road but they ultimately had their happy ending just when i thought the story ended on a beautiful note the epilogue bonus epilogue had me weeping tears of joy do yourself a favor and read this book,positive

things we never got over knockemout,i didnt like knox,4,slight spoilers if you havent read thisthis was my second time reading twngo the first time i probably would have given stars the me that read it a second time didnt love it as much i still loved it but my least fav part of the book was knox the mmc hes a toxic jerk im all for a broody grumpy lead guy but he was beyond that for me the third act breakup was fine for me except that he was getting her naked while formulating a plot to break her heart cringe i dont mind third act breakups but him going from one extreme breaking up with her to telling hernot asking herthey were getting married was idk i just didnt love it im not a knox fan this time around sorryi do like naomi though i feel like the coffee part of her personality went a little too far when that was her first word after she almost died buuuut i still mostly liked her her storyline with her niece waylay was the best parts of this book in my opinion i love waylay side note that teacher who messed with way deserved to be fired among other things not retiredthe secondary characters were also great i love stef lucian and sloane i liked lina enough that im hoping the second book will win me over i do still like this book overall i love lucy score it just hit me a little different than the first time i read it,positive
things we never got over knockemout,really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear book is too long though,4,the book gave me that sad nostalgic feeling of wow that was a really beautiful book the book is a beautiful story about overcoming trauma specifically fears about falling in love this happens for a lot of books im thinking ugly love as another popular romance book but really this book has realistic trauma situations and there are so many pages that you really see the characters change and unravel from their pain points so by the end i really understood the two main characters there are alternating chapter povs the author explained in the note at the end that some of her friends had some tragedies happen to them while she was writing this book and that helped her realize this book would be about choosing to love even when you know it could hurt its definitely the message and theme of this book so its super good in that way this book doubles as a therapy session tbh in the world of mental healthrelationship psychology i would highly recommend this book youre basically watching an anxiousavoidant relationship both become more secure hence the title of the book things we never got over this book is too long im really not kidding the first chapters should have been cut in half like at best the author said in the authors note she did not know what the book would be about when she wrote it i kinda see that still its just a lot of romance building and when i tell you the second half of the book is sooo strong with all the conflict and juicy drama the length of first half was not needed like not needed as someone who reads a lot of scripts for showsmovies i am a big fan that every word on a page as a writer should be earned and so much of the beginning was truly boring to the plot i am impressed by the original readers who kept on going and then gave the book high reviews i truly just kept on reading because this book was talked about so much that i had to see the hype in hindsight i would have read a summary online for the first half of the book and then skipped to chapter and started reading the book from then on still would have been an over page book to read this should be an exciting series the author interweaves other characters love lives so there will be more books in the future that let us see these other characters fall in love i am so excited cause lucy and sloane brought the heat that sometimes i was more engaged in their bickering than in noami and knoxs theres sunshine grumpy love and then theres like good girl submissive energy bad boy dominant energy love and this relationship is more the latter grumpy guys usually arent rude to the actual girl they are more like thoughtful grumpieslike adam carlsen or luke danes this guy at the beginning was just straight rude to the female lead i was like now what the heck and home girl had like no backbone to him for of this book like he straight disrespected her many times so i wasnt really into him as a character i just have a distate for men treating women like garbage but then buying them gifts and so its supposed to be okay um no until of course then in the end i got more proud of him over time but to me hes definitely a guy where hes not really my type but for those who read the book im probably more of a girl like sloane so yes just a heads up for readers its more of the good girl bad boy chemistry lots of relationship psychology and psychoanalyzing sometimes i liked it other times i felt that the author copied and pasted therapy quotes online and put them into the book as in it was very generic quotes about choosing love over fear this book is full of a lot of emotionally unintelligent grown adults being told things they should have learned in their s how have both of the leads not worked through their relationship patterns by now or been told them before these are conversations people usually have in their s but it might just be a generational thing that people are learning how to heal later but just a heads up that characters are being told advice that seemed very young to hear for their age they easily could have been in their s in terms of their behavioroverallreally great book about trauma and choosing love over fear way too long of a book really strong second half and would highly recommend it if you like good girlbad boy love tropes or like relationship psychology since there is a lot of relationship psychoanalyzing that the characters do with each other,positive

things we never got over knockemout,my first romance book was incredible,5,i have never been much of a romantic reader i love fantasy but i care more about action and the plot than the mingling of characters at least thats what i thought before reading this book by lucy score i was pleasantly surprised by this book because the love in question wasnt just between two characters but a new city friendsfamily and a new version of naomi that wasnt expected from the beginning basically if youre thinking about reading this book do it,positive
things we never got over knockemout,this one has mixed opinions but i loved it,4,deciding to reread this one was super fun on my first read i didnt really know what to expect it was already a bookstagram and booktok favorite but i didnt know the plot specifics my first read left me pleasantly surprised i really loved naomi and her relationship with knox i also loved all of the supporting characters and felt like lucy score did a really great job fleshing out each character so they felt unique and distinct from one anothernone of those feelings really changed this time around it was just very comforting to be reacquainted with characters that i already knew that i loved i think i appreciated naomis relationship with waylay even more in my reread just the way that they kept showing up for one another and wanting to be the best version of themselves for the other person was really amazingi do think there were slightly cringey at least to me lines in the first or so pages but thats definitely something i can get overcant wait to get to know nash and lina even more in things we hide from the light,positive

the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,this is not a hero story,5,starsamazon delivered my copy early so im going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one pardon if this winds up sounding like an english paper i have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that i feel like i should have read this in schoolnote im writing this review with the express belief that you reader have at least read the book description otherwise why are you reading this reviewi want to start this off by saying two things one this is not a hero story snow is never once in my opinion shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero hes no luke skywalker or redeemed villain this isnt some sob backstory to explain why the bad guy is bad this is yet another set of layers to the onion that is snowsecond this book is dark its been a minute since i read the original trilogy but i swear it wasnt quite as graphic as this book was cannibalism is mentioned and its showntalked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it one character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded another is also gruesomely displayed after their death several characters are dragged through processions to prove a point another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun multiple accounts of vomitingpoison throughout and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human lifenonspoilery reviewthis book makes you think a lot it makes you question things and wonder if maybe snow is right hes not but its written in such a way that hes not a villain donald sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that snow isnt a villain hes just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piecehe does it so well and he doesnt think hes a bad person he thinks its the only way society can survive and whether you think hes right or wrong he doesnt think hes bad he likes himselfthis should be the mantra for this book snow is a conflicting flawed human in our society hes evil a sociopath or a psychopath hes a murderer and a killer hes a bad guy in his world hes one of the masses he simply lives as hes been raised to with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the districts and the capitol hes simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the hard decisionsregardless of the other characters in this theyre all props to his storywhich fits well with the snow we know from the hunger games everyone is second stage to snow and his life this is his evolution from being a child to a man to becoming the snow we know and lovehatei definitely dont think this book is for everyone im sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she cant wait to read it and i dont think shell like it at all and shes a diehard thg trilogy fan why because not everyone likes to read depressing books theres no redemption in this theres no saving someone from themselves this is the fall stumble plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fullyso take that as you will full spoilers below about everythingps this is a standalonespoilers belowokay so i was worried about this book when i read the first chapter sample and it got announced that snow would be training the district girl i thought oh crap its gonna be a cliche ya its gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap and yeah it did that and up until the last pages i was teetering on a stars and then oh boy the endlucy grey was a sweet girl but she felt off since the beginning i still cant fully put my finger on it but her and snows relationship felt so iwrongi the entirety of the book the red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his and even so far as to say she was his property and thats all kinds of wrong and even though their romance was cute and fluffy it felt bad tainted you knew something was going to happen it always does in these villain backstories usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then theyre like whelp guess ill just be evilnot in this booksnow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this should he turn in his friend to the capitol because theyre colluding with rebels and could tear down the flawed infrastructure or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing is the hunger games wrong or good is it wrong to view the district people as second class humans and so on this book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole districtcapitol thing youve always known there was a divide between them but in this you really see how much the capitol looks down on the districts and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time katniss first enters the hunger gamesbut i digress snow struggles with morality but hes flawed and very very imperfect he rationalizes every death he takes as selfdefense or some other reason when really hes just murdered someone because its inconvenient for him he kills or at least removes her from the picture its ambiguous lucy grey in the end because shes a loose end and too free he does it not someone else not some freak accident he chooses to do it and by the time it happens you already know what direction hes headed in so its not quite another nail in the coffin it fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wantsall the nods to thg characters and names was cool you also had a lot of the great gatsby vibes in the old money versus new money mentality that a lot of the capitol had with district people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the capitol life theyre looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trashyou saw a lot of the evolution in the hunger games and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what katniss and peeta suffered through you see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thingyou also see a side of the capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogysuffering a lot of the book shows snow struggling with having been a small child living through the dark days and the war he was when the capitol won and even then it was hard you learn about the hell the capitol lived through as they were besieged by the districts army and forced to ration starvation and cannibalism its a hard picture and its so blatantly told collins didnt hold back any punches in this i never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader but it was definitely that for the story and it made sense regardless of the capitol not being at war with the districts anymore the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events so when one mentor gets killed by her tribute they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentors funeral its disgusting debasing and shows how much the capitol views the districts as nothing more than rodents or livestockanyway ill stop talking go read it yourself its a hard read a heavy read but it was very very enjoyable,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,ted bundy coriolanus and the joker,5,the ballad of songbirds and snakesas most readers already know this prequel explores coriolanuss life when he was a teenager the opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for lucy gray who was from the despised district but what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer lucy gray learned how to work a situation to her advantagein the beginning the tributes did not enjoy capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed its a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foodsthe problem was that watching too much brutality turned the capitol away from the games snows addition to the hunger games of costumes interviews and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy this should be a cautionary talea lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make in the opening of this book theres a quote by hobbeshereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe they are in that condition which is called warre and such a warre as is of every man against every man thomas hobbes leviathan coriolanuss first lesson to be molded into the future oppressor was during the hunger games when he was forced to go in the arena to get out sejanus one of the mentors who was not supposed to be in there while at the hospital getting stitches the head gamekeeper dr gaul asked if coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learnwithout the threat of death it wouldnt have been much of a lesson said dr gaul what happened in the arena thats humanity undressed the tributes and you too how quickly civilization disappears all your fine manners education family background everything you pride yourself on stripped away in the blink of an eye revealing everything you actually are a boy with a club who beats another boy to death thats mankind in its natural statei think i wouldnt have beaten anyone to death if you hadnt stuck me in that arena he retortedyou can blame it on the circumstances the environment but you made the choices you made no one else its a lot to take in all at once but its essential that you make an effort to answer that question who are human beings because who we are determines the type of governing we need later on i hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonighta very similar thought process was also stated by the joker in the dark nightto them youre just a freak like me they need you right now but when they dont theyll cast you out like a leper you see their morals their code its a bad joke dropped at the first sign of trouble theyre only as good as the world allows them to be ill show you when the chips are down these these civilized people theyll eat each other see im not a monster im just ahead of the curveboth the joker and dr gaul has distorted thinking its one thing to make a choice freely and its quite another thing to be forced into onehuman nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppressionlater as coriolanuss feelings toward lucy gray grew he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district sejanus joined him there soon aftersejanus was never one who was comfortable with the capital and its way of life he got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north out of panemcoriolanus found out about sejanus plot mayfair threatens to tell her father the mayor everything which would implicate coriolanus and lucy gray despite them being only bystanders he shot hersejanus is charged with treason and hanged and lucy gray baird is the main suspect in billy taupe her ex rebel boyfriend and mayfairs deaths as he left her for the mayors daughterin desperation lucy gray decides to join the rebels up north and coriolanus decides to go with her thinking theres nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were foundbut as they prepare to flee district snow gets paranoid that lucy gray is betraying him when they stop at a house near district s lake he discovers the rebels store of the weapons when lucy gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him inwhat if they interrogated or even tortured her the story would come out she hadnt killed anyone he had his word against hersbut even though snow searches for her lucy gray was nowhere to be foundthe three killings that snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and ptsd coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute bobbin in the hunger games arena he also shoots the mayors daughter and also turns in his best friend sejanus for treason resulting in his executionlucy gray was the last straw for his sanity back at the capital the reader sees snows change to the dark sidesometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently but it would never have worked out between them even if hed stayed they were simply too different and he didnt like love the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable if he ever married hed choose someone incapable of swaying his heart someone he hated even so they could never manipulate him the way lucy gray had never make him feel jealous or weak livia cardew would be perfect he imagined the two of them the president and his first lady presiding over the hunger games a few years from now hed continue the games of course when he ruled panem people would call him a tyrant ironfisted and cruel but at least he would ensure survival for survivals sake giving them a chance to evolve what else could humanity hope for really it should thank himthis happened to ted bundy as i believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him if you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriendrejection is a powerful force in a persons life if they are not stable dr gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,a fantastic villain origin story,5,i adored the hunger games series dystopian ya is not a normal genre for me but this series is awesome and this prequel a fantastic villain origin storycoriolanus snow is an ambitious yearold student whose wealthy family barely survived the war he is all about image and pretense which often vie against his normal human feelings his parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin tigrisbut the th hunger games is to be the first one with mentors and coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from district while at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district he quickly realizes that lucy gray is someone who could win and its up to him to figure out how to help her do that along the way coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bringas he works his way through the games he also discovers who wields the power in the capitol who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the massesthe student mentors also have a say in how the games are run and in a somewhat twisted sort of way their professor gives assignments and in coriolanus essays we see how future games come about and evolve as the mentors talk about the games and what is happening we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind they view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the games really are at the same time we see that those in the capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebelsthe hunger games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery this book however was almost more black and gray in its imagery what with the rubble of the arena and the capitol still trying to rebuild from the war that made the contrast of lucy grays colorful skirt and the snakes all the more strikingas with the rest of the series we see the government oppression we see the results of war and rebellion we see society broken but fighting and we see that even with survival life isnt grand and colorful but we also see that the human spirit is strongno one likes who president snow becomes and i think writing about his story so that he gains the readers sympathy is brilliant the story isnt fastpaced but it drew me in and kept me enthralled,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,an authors initial perspective on the ballad of songbirds and snakes,5,as a ya dystopian author i wanted to learn from the best so i purchased this book on my birthday just a day after i published my own dystopian bookthe hunger games series sparked my passion for writing so this book holds a special place in my heart but i knew i had to let go of that bias because this is an entirely new thing i need to read this not as a reader but as an author so i approached this book with a careful eye just like any other character who approaches a jabberjay in the seriesthe perspective of the ballad of songbirds and snakes isnt new to me simply because its from the villains voice its new in a way as it explores the coming of age tale of coriolanus snows cleverly paranoid overthinking mindi knew what will happen to coriolanus snow so i gripped my seat as i approved in my kindle oasis it was simply impossible i dont see anything bad from happening i asked myself how will suzanne collins end thisand she didand i couldnt believe itit was so captivating that i couldnt put it down i will not put any spoilers here but i just want to say inevitable as the sunrise betrayals leave behind a trail of destruction for the snake snow will always fall,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,quite the read,5,i have such mixed emotions after finishing this book but first of all this book is absolutely incredible i honestly think it might be my favorite book of the hg series and ms collins absolutely does not disappoint with her writing and content getting to read about panem and thus the beginning of the hg was so gratifying and the way this story flowed into and matched up with the trilogy was absolutely flawless truly it is excellentnow its kind of rare to read a book when the protagonist is the villain we all clearly know from the hg trilogy that president snow is a pretty terrible person yet reading this book from his point of view its easy to forget that but its also fascinating to see how he thinks of himself and sees his own actions along that same thought snow is very charismatic and definitely knows how to work the people around him to get what he wants or to present himself in a way that will clearly benefit himself often at the cost of someone elseminor spoiler the other part of snows life that i do find incredibly sad while he definitely has poor character traits to begin with he was also very manipulated by several people around him which i think added considerably to how he turned out as an adult and very much shaped his viewpoint and his creation of the gamesso definitely worth the read and reread this book is very thoughtprovoking even from outside the dystopian viewpoint there are a lot of reflections on who we are as humans as groups societies on the roles of government and the rights of its citizensfor the many pages it reads quickly hope you enjoy it as much as i did,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,if you love the hunger games buy this book,5,ok i was skeptical on getting this book but i have to say after reading it i absolutely love it i always wanted to know about snow and how he came to be the way he was in the books this book explains it all i am one of those that read the hunger games at least once a year im telling you right now this is going to be in the lineup itll probably be the first book that i read i love learning about his cousin and then remembering that she ended up in the hunger games as well the names of the kids that went to school with him im just saying it is a good read it is one of those that you dont want to put it down enjoy the book have fun and may the odds be ever in your favor,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,the ballad of songbirds and snakes,5,i was skeptical about this book keeping my interest it is a prequel which usually at least gives a few kernels that make the original trilogy a deeper experiencei was wrong like really wrong collins always delivers and this book is a testament to her talent there are more than a few kernels to be mined here the title itself is quite clever as this is lucy grays story tooi cant say more nor list any topic specifically without spoilers i can say we watch the evolution of a capitolborn citizen trying for a better life to the man who would become president of panemncv,positive
the ballad of songbirds and snakes a hunger games novel the hunger games,great addition to the series,4,the ballad of songbirds and snakes by suzanne collins is a captivating and original addition to the hunger games series this prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the hunger games and explores the complex character of coriolanus snow who later becomes president snow giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded the story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the hunger games world offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy while it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books it compensates with its rich character development and thoughtprovoking themes and the lack of action makes sense given the setting and novelty of the hunger games at that point this novel is a mustread for fans of the hunger games series as it adds depth and complexity to a world we thought we knew so well making it an enthralling and thoughtprovoking experience from start to finish though the openending was a little confusing to me,positive

a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,three books review and a little spoilers,5,these were some of the best books ive read in a long time sarah left nothing undone when it came to describing a world that doesnt exist her story was original in many ways and in others you could see how it was similar to many others of its genre her characters were so engaging you could feel there happiness their pain their conflict i would recommend these books to everyone who loves fantasy oh and the fight scenes although not throughly detailed was enough to draw you in and make you feel as though you were in the battle with themi know there are two other books number is a very long epilogue so if you want to check up on feyre and rhys family thatd be the book book is nestas book i have not read that book and will be putting it off for awhile because in all honesty she was one of the only characters in the book i really did not like having said that im sure book is supposed to be somewhat of a book redeeming her but im a little upset that she gets a book and lucien doesnt or azriel for that matterthey were the only two characters that had the saddest back ground and deserved a hea not nesta she was a grade a b mor could be seen as another character that had a tragic back story and in need of an hea but i dont agree i hate how she strings azriel along because she is a selfish coward just like nesta but not so much of a heartless bif sarah does come out with books for these worthy males i hope she chooses a different female for them than elaine lucien deserves someone who will love him the way feyre loves rhys and elaine needs a male wholl love her the way rhys loves feyre i cannot see elaine and lucien having that same connection as the two i mentioned and azriel cannot love sweet elaine that way either cause he will always be tied in someway to mor you cant drop years of longing and insta fall for someone else especially if shes not his mate which mor is azriel will always put mor before elaine when mor comes clean and finally lets azriel go hell need time to heal and that would be a good time for someone not in their circle to help him through that one could argue with time and the right setup elaine and lucien could make it work and be just as enthralled with each other as our power couple but lucien has some soul searching to do something rhys didnt have to do he was everything feyre neededfinally tamlin some would put him in the same category as nesta and mor but i dont tamlin has a good heart feyre broke that heart did tamlin handle things wrong yes but he could have been so much more hateful and wasnt instead he came to there aid saved feyre spied for the alliance and even helped bring rhys back to life because he absolutely loved feyre his book would be an adventure for sure the female would have to be fierce as well as soft and definitely more mature than feyre she matured quite a bit after everything that happened under the mountain but tamlins and feyres love was built before that and had she been more mature she wouldnt have fallen for him so easily she would have been more cautious and discerning my heart broke a little for him even if i am team rhys and feyrejust my two cents enjoy reading these books,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,spoilers,5,i loved every moment in this book i was worried that after a court of mist and fury that the rest of the series would not hold up while acomaf is my favorite so far aowar definitely held it owni love all the new characters that we got to meet in this book along with all the new relationshipsi love the connection between all the high lords we get to see a lot more of their history and the relationships that they all had prior to the current timelinemany secrets were reveled in this book or more so truths that have not yet been toldmor and her secret that now only feyre knows i love this direction for her but i also am sadden for the relationship i was hoping for for her and azriel i hope that in the future books we get to see more of their friendship i hope they will both have new love interest in the future booksherion and lucian father and son i hope this is something that gets brought up again in the net bookthe relationships that still have so much questioning and i cannot wait to see what happensobviously my favorite is feyre and rhys enough saidcassian and nesta are they mates not mate what i need more i need to know there is something more there and i cannot wait to read more to find outamern and varian i just need more of these two i love the little bits that we got in this booklucian and elain we know they are mates elain is still in love with her human ex fianc greyson ew i love how gentle and understanding lucian is and backs away when she needs him tooall the twist at the end that got me the most feyre nesta and elains father i was in tears he calls himself the prince of merchants he told me hes got three daughters who live here and that he failed them for many years but he would not fail them this time the ships at the front of the human armada became clear along with the gold lettering on their sides he named his three personal ships after them drakon said with a smile and there sailing at the fronti beheld the names of those shipsthe feyrethe elainand leading the charge against hybern flying over the waves unyielding and without an ounce of fearthe nestawith my fatherour father at the helmi love this for these three so much i completely forgot about their father and kind of just wrote him off then out of nowhere he has been battling and rallying for his girls he didnt know they were fae and was right in the middle of everything happening but he knew they were there and need help i am sad that the king of hybern killed their father i would have really like to see more of his thoughts on becoming them becoming fae and what happened to them in his absence amrens betraying not betraying feyre let me tell ya i was so mad for a hot minute i had to put the book down i could not believe what was happening i was thinking no way amren is on the wrong side of this she has helped and done so much then the twistthe suriel left the message to feyre for amren for amren to release her true self so that she alone can defeat hyberns army the begging from both feyre and varian for amren not to release her true self because she would not remember them she would not be able to return but she is able to come back but she now is differentshe looked to varian a wry smile on her red mouth i watched them mostthe humans who loved i never understood ithow it happened why it happened she paused a step away from the cauldron i think i might have learned with you though perhaps that was a last gift too varians face twisted with anguish but he made no further move to stop her she turned to me and spoke the words into my headthe spell i must think and feel and do i nodded when i am free amren said to us do not run it will attract my attention she lifted a steady hand toward my armi am glad we met feyre i smiled at her bowing my head me too amren me too amren grabbed my wrist and swung herself into the cauldron rhys dying i did not see this coming i have never had a book where one of my favorite characters dies or a main character die i normally love the smaller characters more call me cheesy but i love love when he died and once feyre noticed what had happened my gut wrenchedrhys was sprawled on the rocky ground wings draped behind him he looked like he was sleeping but as i breathed in it wasnt there that thing that rose and fell with each breath that echoed each heartbeat the mating bond it wasnt there it was gone because his own chest it was not moving and rhys was deadthe after math of this was just a much heart wrenching maybe even worse feyre begging everyone to help rhys and just when you think no one can help him feyre asks the high lords to bring him back like they did her they need them all to do it even tamlin feyre says she would,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,the war has come who will survive and who will lose everything spoilers,5,o this is the climax of the series as far as i am concerned this book gets a lot of hate but it is honestly my favorite book of the serieso overview spoilers i have never in my life had so many feelings about a man in my real life let alone in a book i lost count how many times i closed this book and just shook the crap out of it because tamlin made me so mad good lord man this dang book had me so in my feelings about everything every single time i turned the pageo this is the climax of the night court story itself the war with hybern and trying to save the fae lands and the courts hybern makes a deal with tamlin and they bring the night court to his court and drag in feyres human sisters forcing them into the cauldron to become made but what they dont know is that nesta ever the fighter took from the cauldron just as it was taking from her and her sister which was when the human queens part of the treaty see that hybern promised immortality from the cauldron with the sisters as tests run but something was taken from cauldron so it takes from the next one in the cauldron therefore making the queens mad war comes nesta saves cassian twice hybern kills the girls father and elain stabs him but nesta has the killshot and removes his head the girls father shows up with an armada when drakon and myriam show up with boats named after the girls the cauldron calls elain and they search for her feyre and amren and varian find the cauldron but amren deceives feyre and dives into the cauldron she becomes her true form and wipes out mostly everything in the war with fire the cauldron explodes into three pieces and rhys and feyre save it by mending it back together because feyre remembers that all life comes from the cauldron but when she comes back to reality rhys is lying on the ground and not breathing she begs the high lords to fix him like they did her so they do and he comes backo along the way feyre faces fears that the bone carver told her about to free him to get him to fight with them against hybern also faces bryaxis the dark thing in the lowest level of the library where the priestesses work at the house of wind rhys frees the weaver of the wood bone carvers sister to help as well hybern kills the bone carver and the weaver of the wood and bryaxis is still missing at the end of the booko there is just so freaking much that happens in this book and that is why it is my favorite the weaving of stories is immaculate within this book i know that quite a few people dont like sarah j mass writing but i did for sure im also new to the fae writing etc however i did definitely like this one the best out of all of them and i would reread it times if i could the ending and beginning of stories throughout this is just one that i wish i could read for the first time again,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,i will try my best to make this spoilerfree because so much happens,5,oh goodness i will try my best to make this spoilerfree because so much happensnow this book came to me on its release day thank you amazon i started reading it almost immediately and then i had exams this is why it took me so long to finish it i would try to read it before work or before class but i wouldnt be fast enoughso we know what happened in the second book feyre went back to tamlin but surprise its just a little trick she will find her way back to rhysandduh she does thats not really a spoilerwar is looming and she as the high lady must work with the night court and her mate rhysand in order to win this war and bring peace to all literallyso i want to write this review differently we love these characters so much so i am going to break it down by character no spoilers will be revealed for the characters i will be carefulnew characters are introduced in this book but i will be letting you know about the familiar characters feyre so the ending of the second book had us shook for real in the third book feyre is truly a badass she is not taking any of tamlins shit let me tell you that she is determined to find her way back to rhysand and yes she does as noted above when they reunite of course there is the lovemaking they wouldnt be mates if they didnt get it on you know anywayits a bit of an emotional reunion for feyre seeing her friends and such especially her sisters we get a glimpse of them almost immediately but ill talk about them lately throughout the book feyre is now a high lady of the night court she slowly learns how to control a room and she learns more about herself this book really shows us how strong feyre really is rhysand right now rhysand is probably going through hell because he isnt with feyre and he isnt sure when she will be back it gets kind of worse when feyre tries to get back to him during that journey their bond is silent when they reunite you get that giddy feeling reading their interactions again and im actually glad their separation doesnt really last long this is only if you ship them though in this book i definitely got a sense of a struggle with rhysand its almost as if the ending of the second book and its events really made him vulnerable and he is definitely scared of losing feyre and we learn more about his time with amarantha when he was her icky love slave or whatever we learn more things too i like this side of him this vulnerable side there are moments during the impending war where he expresses his fear of losing his family im going to say that there is a moment with rhysand where you stare at the book and you want to burst into tears thats all no spoilers lucien everybody wants lucien they wanted more of lucien im going to say in my own opinion that i was kind of disappointed in luciens part of the story i feel like there was not enough of him he seemed to be absent physically for over half of the book before its release i saw that people were excited to read more of lucien and his pov but i was disappointed that it was lacking i think his story isnt over yet though there didnt seem to be any closure for him hopefully since this world continues we will get more nesta oh nesta i think she is a lovehate character we get more of her in this book and she becomes more likable though still frustrating lets just say the situation between her and cassian drags and it just makes you roll your eyes not at sarah of course at nesta she is so stubborn and it just annoyed me at times however with that aside she definitely learns to become stronger and to accept herself as a fae which i find important i mean she doesnt have much of a choice she still has the attitude in her but she has her badass moments elain oh man it was heartbreaking to read about elain and how she was handling things i dont know how else to describe it really its even worse when lucien tries to interact with her with hardly any progress in this book elain is stuck on grayson i mean we know that isnt going to happen anymore but its just sad again with lucien i dont think her story is finished there are some unanswered questions on a happier note elain learns to find her voice and her inner strength after what she went through that made up for the rest of it cassian oh cassian he is still a smartass but something is definitely up with him here im pretty sure its because of nesta and her ignorance of him he tries to hide the fact it bothers him but you can tell it really does we also see cassians bond with rhysand and how strong it really is their fear of losing each other in this war cassian definitely wants to prove himself in this war and we see that but some of the scenes were scary not sinister or anything but as a reader you are very scared and worried something bad will happen to him ill stop there for your sakeim combining a few other characters together for one reason amren azriel mor tamlin why are these characters combined well lets start with amren we only see amren when she is helping nesta and her connection with the cauldron there is a scene of betrayal sort of but besides her amazing ending she doesnt feature that muchazriel is kind of the same he felt too much like a background character for me and though there are scenes where you pray for him as you keep reading i wish he was featured more i dont think he got much closure eitherwhich brings me to mor oh man we have a bombshell with her i wont reveal that though but i wlll say her lack of closure goes with azrieltamlin tamlin i hate him but i kind of dont after reading this book he spends most of the time just being pissy about what feyre did making innuendo jokes to get a rise and just acting like a fifteen year old however there are moments where it seems he wants some kind of redemption or something i will say that i do think he is still in love with feyre but i think his story is at an end the closure is definitely there and hopefully he will find his own happinessi want to reiterate that these opinions are my own opinions and how i felt about the bookregardless of some of the negative opinions i am still giving this book five stars this book had me on edge and im glad but sad that this is the last full novel unless the book gods and sarah want to bless us with another full novel that isnt a novella or something im still prayingif you havent read this book because you are scared dont let that stop you i was scared the whole way and i kept reading i am very happy with this book and i loved entering this world again this will probably be a series that i will definitely reread that doesnt happen oftenbottom line youll always be wanting more of feyres story,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,best read of,5,when you erupt girl make sure it is felt across worldsi seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review im going to try not to include any spoilers but if there are any ill give you fair warning before reading further honestly i am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book i honestly dont know how sjm can top this book but lets get real hereshe will because shes just that amazing i read this in one sitting overnight because i simply couldnt put it down its true this book is a court of pain and feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and i felt incomplete after finishing sjm seriously took her writing to new heights and i cant even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journeythe great joy and honour of my life has been to know you to call you my family and i am grateful more than i can possibly say that i was given this time with you alli have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because i always felt that it showed sarah j maas extreme writing talent its so different from the throne of glass series and i loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story you can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her and every scene is richly described her writing truly sweeps you away and its something that you easily lose yourself in i know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into feyres world i would not even hesitate this story is complex and i never expected for sjm to build on the world so much more than previously but she does and its excellent there is a great progression to the story and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characterswhat we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strengththe book starts with feyre back in the spring court with tamlin while some people might have found this part slow i think it showcased just how far feyre has come as a character the strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her and rhysands plot was utterly fantastic i think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us feyres mindset at the time i definitely got some aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass feyre was which just added to my love for her character but the best thing feyres characterization i thought she was welldeveloped already but sjm added yet another layer to her character feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book looking back i cant even believe that this is the same personand that is an excellent thing it shows how much rhys and the night court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately becomei would have waited five hundred more years for you a thousand years and if this was all the time we were allowed to have the wait was worth itrhys is as perfect as ever i mean come onwho doesnt love him the way he treats feyre made me swoon every darn time and she is his high lady in every single way he gives her something that tamlin never didrespect he believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing he allows her to spread her wings this is an excellent pun btwi know im really not as funny as i think and embrace her magic the constant support and love rhys shows her is something every girl should have plus hes freaking hilariousyou cant get a better man i honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top book boyfriends obviously the chemistry between feyre and rhys is off the charts and all the sex scenes are perfectly written i love them together so much it just makes my heart happyits a rare person to face who they are and not run from it not be broken by itcassian and nesta are brilliant and i firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books i need them together and i need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story they have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book we learn more about mor and my heart broke for her multiple times i just wanted to give her a giant hug but i loved delving deeper into her character azriel is brooding as ever but i love him there is definitely something up with him and elain and i need to know what that something is amrens sass is pure gold and i love her so much there are definitely some surprises with her character that left me along with the characters shocked we also meet a new high lord helion and god do i love him he has to be in these next books because hes awesome we also see the return of the bone carver and the suriel and seriouslythey play epic roles in the story and tamlini have to mention this guy i actually liked how sjm handled him in this book especially at the end it was realistic and believable and lord help me i didnt hate him anymoremy rage had become a living thing inside my chest an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to wakingmy favorite part about this book though besides all the other stuff is its unpredictability seriously sjm gave me a heart attack multiple times just when i thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story and there was not not but major things at the end in which i was freaking out and making very weird noises that im sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate the one major and i mean major thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock i seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life and i was praying so hard that sjm didnt do what she did i think i stopped breathing at one point so how dare you sarah j maas how dare you scare me like thatit is a new world and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anewif you couldnt tell i loved this book i still am not okay after reading the entire battle since sjm made me lose my mind but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything i could want most of the main questions were answered but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing i think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters perspectives but im never going to mind more feyre and rhys this is by far the best read of and you need to read it as soon as humanly possiblehappy reading,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,for a heartbeat i weighed who i had been with who i was now supposed to be,5,acowar has been an interesting change over my course of reading the acotar series i enjoyed the shift away from deep character development and relationship building toward more political intrigue and solidifying of the world around usbook three allows us to deepen our already established views of the characters and their relationships continue to understand the world while expanding on the larger picture while we danced with these political issues in the past books it was a wonderful treat to focus on something new for book threein addition we also get to meet new characters while learning about the connections and relationships between our old friends as well as the new ones while a lot of the character development felt halted as we built on the political intrigue i did find myself expanding my thoughts and reconsidering character dynamicsspoilerthis includes a bit of surprise for me as i started to feel a bit of sympathy for tamlin and started to consider the trauma that led to his action hes still not the hero in my eyes and i continue to adore rhysand but i do hope to see a happy ending for tamlinspoilerthe emotional connection deepens with each of the books in this series i continue to find myself with deep emotions throughoutacotar acomaf and now acowar continue to tighten their claws around me as i sprint into the fourth bookthe mix of awe and anger and the realization that the world was large and beautiful and sometimes so overwhelming in its wonder that it was impossible to drink it down all at once,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,soooo sooooo but not worth the hype for me,3,i could go on for awhile on this but i wont i will probably not finish the next in the seriesthe first book was stars then the second was and this was maybe even why low stars so many reasons but really it was how i felt after finishing the book relieved i was donerhys and feyreso i originally loved them together they were hot and kept you on your toes then they happen in this book and its boring and cheesy and bland and just plain cringy rhys turns into some doe eyed teary emotional and not at all badss fae like hes originally portrayed instead hes the sacrificial lamb he has pined to be over and over and we hear about it constantly oh rhys you sacrificed so much for us let us repay you rinse repeat again and againsome more examples of constant rinse and repeat this is your choice feyre we are a team i will never take your choice away take that passive aggressiveness tamlin oh wait nope just the reader gets to take it over and over and overeach and every time the author reminds us of feyres choicelets talk tamlin shall we feyre did him dirty i know i know im sure im in the minority here but it just aggravates me when the whole point of contention in books is boiled down to a simple lack of communication and that really was all it was she fell out of love moved on but no one really told tamlin so he went under the wrong assumptions for so long it really was aggravating he was kind to her and truly loved her sure he eventually said some terrible things to her but a man scorned he was and really if she was simply more upfront with him than her lousy letter i wish you well or something dumb like that i wouldnt be all up in arms about itthe book is long very long and yet we get nothing of lucian and his new mate like nothing they still have only had maybe whole sentences between each other by the end of this page book so i have no idea if they are even covered in the other booksnow dont think i forgot nesta ugh i wish i would shes a raging b pretty much of the book it gets old real fast yet shes written like a hero to save their day shes written essentially oh she has problems with dealing with things and expressing her emotions well so its ok she treats everyone else like trash she has an excuse i hate that shiz just because you are sad or mad or hurting does not give you the right to hurt others nesta says to feyre why didnt you tell us you couldnt read i did not now and would have helped you yeah sure b you treated feyre like a sack of doo doo and never truly worried about her when she was dangerously hunting for the family or freezing to death or whatever other sacrifices feyre made while you neveroncesaidthanks so no nesta gets no free pass from me she never once redeemed herself in this book and i am only sorry cassian is stuck with her frozen hearted soulthe whole mor and azrial thing sad like why make us think one thing only to make it sooo much less fulfilling i loved azrial and his soft spoken loyal soul only to have to deal with whatever the heck mor has going on talk about stringing someone along forzillions of yearsjust disappointed with this book when i invested so much time i expected a bit more i suppose dont get me wrong there were good parts but for me the bad parts made this book a star read for me,neutral
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,keeps getting better,5,love lovelove this author and series when i finished the first book in this series i had to get the next one asap but when i read the synopsis of the next books my heart dropped into my bunny slippers and i thought my head would explode the plot was heading to people and places i did not want to contemplate i had to put the brakes on and really consider whether i wanted to go in that direction after much thought i decided that since the first book was so great that i d have to trust the author to make it all work out but i was only willing to get book just in case so as i started reading i kept worrying that i would not be able to complete it but thank the mother and the author i did and i was so glad i was amazed at the authors plotting skills i loved it more than the first book at that point i bought the rest of the series and of her other series sarah j maas i will never doubt you again thanks,positive
a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,fast paced and addictive,5,my rage had become a living thing inside my chest an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking sarah j maasfeyre is ready to fight in this final installment of the acotar trilogy not counting the novella having failed to damage the cauldron in acomaf feyre is taken into the spring court under the guise of having been brainwashed tamlin believes her leaving him was all rhysands doing she encourages this misbelief determined to rip apart tamlins court from the inside meanwhile the king of hybern is done staging his troops for war hes ready to bring prythian to its knees he plans to strike hard at the wall then sweep across the land and take all the courts the only way to stop him is to unite all the high lords and even then it might not be enough it will take something short of a miracle to bring him down but the world has some unexpected allies in the form of monsters it also has feyre amren nesta and elain these strong women are unlike others for more than one reason but especially because they are made they just might have what it takes to save everyone even if it kills themcrying im crying or i was i dont remember the last time i cried so much in a book happy tears sad tears sometimes i was just crying because of how emotional this book made me like rhysands little circle up before the final battle which reminded me a lot of the final battle in lotr btw rhysands words to all his friends this might be the last time they are all together that was all i could think as tears washed down my face as a sense of foreboding and fear settled over me deep down i was thinking sjm wouldnt dare kill any of themrightrighti believe everything happens for a reason whether it is decided by the mother or the cauldron or some sort of tapestry of fate i dont know i dont really care but i am grateful for it whatever it is grateful that it brought you all into my life if it hadnt i might have become as awful as that prick were going to face todaythe plot in this book was faster paced than acomaf a lot faster everything happens in rapid succession theres no time to catch your breath feyre is in spring court for the first part bringing it down and then running for her life and theres the meeting of the high lordswhich was omg tenseand the attack at the library all the battles you get the picture its go go goin terms of world building sjm really tied things off nicely i loved her introduction of some of the monsters giving us an even deeper glimpse into prythian like the use of the weaver the bone carver and the creature from the depths of the library for the war we got to see all the high lords together we got to see more magic everything was brought to a nice close in that regardthere was still plenty of romance and hints of new romance to come like cassian and nesta so excited for their upcoming novella and elain and lucian if that ever happensnesta looked at the king with death twining around his hands then down at cassian and covered cassians body with her own cassian went still then his hand slid over her back together theyd go togetheri really liked the way rhysand and feyres relationship strengthened too that he trusted her with things as dangerous as sneaking in to the king of hyberns camp to rescue her sister spoke volumesyou do not fear you do not falter you do not yield you go in you get her and you come out againwow that quote though those two are my favorite bookish couple of all time hands down he could have insisted on doing it himself or even sending someone else but he trusted feyre because she was confident that she could succeedin terms of character development where the last book was feyre healing i felt this book was her coming into her own she really learned how to take matters into her own hands how to be strong how to make her own decisions she definitely did some growing with rhysands encouragement no less she looked into the mirror and saw who she really was and she accepted thatthe other character arc that stood out to me was tamlins even though it happened mostly in the background he went from feeling he owned feyre to finally accepting that she wasnt his but even more he saved her life that in my eyes fully redeemed him i still find fault with him and hes not my favorite but he saved her lifethe ending was a little surprising but very satisfying for me i really didnt expect amarin to come back but she did and im happier for it i liked that she came back changed andrhysand dying that wasim not sure at first i thought it was unnecessary but the more i think about it i think it was necessary because we needed tamlin to be the final say in the matter we needed that final acorn of life from him we needed to see that tamlin had finally accepted feyres choice that he would rather see feyre happy even if it meant he couldnt have her that to me tied off his character arc nicelythis

a court of wings and ruin a court of thorns and roses,the story and writing are superb,5,spoilersa fantastic written work i am a sucker for happy endings well mostly a happy ending anyway at least in this book feyre and rhys and crew jetting off constantly to face danger and war and try to make their world a better place they accomplished much and have the makings for the peace and unity they crave so hopefully things will go well if theres another book to this seriesi did not like feyres plan or execution of her plan to deceive tamlin faking her feelings to get out from under hybern was prudent in the moment but when she went back to the spring court and sowed discontent and disrupted the trust tamlins court had in him i was let down especially since tamlins actions at the time were in an attempt to save feyre misguided though his goals were id have much preferred if feyre disappeared from spring again after talking to tamlin too i never really bought into feyres hatred of tamlin yes he stifled her and locked her in his house with wards up and it was devastating after her stay under the mountain but it wasnt so egregious in my opinion to garner such strong dislike from feyre tamlin loses her and lucian from his court at the same time in a nest of king hyberns goals its just that much sadder to find that tamlin was trying to fight against the king through the keeping his enemies close adage and he comes through for her in the end when she and azriel go to that enemy camp to save her sister elain my hope would be that tamlin finds himself a mate down the line hes been battered enough i thinkrhys oh rhys i liked him under the mountain when he was bad but knowing the truth behind the mask is perfect too he makes mistakes but his heart is in the right place and his selflessness and attempts to shield others so takes more on himself in sacrifice of everything he has and is breaks me when he dies putting it into repairing the cauldron thankfully the other high lords survive the battlefield and give them his essence plus fayre so that hes resurrected i wouldnt have liked the outcome had he remained dead but it does make me wonder if it would work for all of the other high lords and what that knowledge will mean in future for the courtsthank you for finally revealing the story behind mors inability to love azriel the way he desires the next step is for her to actually tell him that she prefers women i like azriel the best and he should hear what she says so that he can move on fully i think i also want mor to be happy with whoever she chooses without fear of what others think its curious though that mor has her sexuality hanging over her head when one of the high lords has a same sex mate makes no sensecassian and nesta have the beginnings of something if shell allow it the care is evident between them but after the final battle she seemed to withdraw instead of move forward on what they were building together her desperate cries for him on the battlefield saved his life so id think shed be loathe to waste more timeamsen was a surprise i didnt realize what she was doing when she slammed the book shut just after fayre touched the cauldron but no way did i ever think amsen was a traitor tricks up her sleeve she had but my thought was that she and nesta had figured it out and nesta would have to be the sacrifice especially since nesta was the most connected to the cauldron amsen sacrificed herself but again she was brought back by rhys no longer otherworldly just high fae but shes there in the end and hopefully can build something with varianlucian has almost no role in this book which i thought was disappointing but it was cute seeing his reactions to and around elain hes so careful and considerate and clearly wants the bond but is being patient wish them both happiness in whatever future they have but i think itll be a while for elain shes still clearly devastated by her mortal mate greysons reaction to her fae transformation it was incongruous that the gentle son as previously portrayed was more harsh and unforgiving than his father who had been portrayed as just that intolerant of fae elain is almost childlike in this book and doesnt interact much with everyone else i forgot about her until the cauldron snatched her away that she was the one who stabbed king haybern wasnt a surprise to me but given her nature to that point im glad she seemed to take something of herself backoutside of rhys my favorite high lord was helion cant put a finger on exactly why but maybe because i sense he needs something more to his life that hes probably lucians father was a revelation that was a shock but i wished feyre or someone had told them both lucians mother loves helion but is married to baron whom his son eris is plotting to kill im not sure what that would then mean for his mother and helion but only time will tell if there are more books written,positive

the coworker,a great twisty psychological thriller,4,i love freida mcfaddens writing she always keeps me guessing and her newest book the coworker is no exceptionnatalie farrell is a sales representative and dawn schiff is an accountant at vixed a nutritional supplement company natalie is beautiful and popular and everything seems to come so easily for her dawn is the complete opposite she is socially awkward plain looking and her only real friend is her childhood best friend mia they do have one thing in common though they both have dark secrets when dawn goes missing natalie finds herself in the middle and her perfect life is blown apartdawn is always at her desk at am sharp so when natalie showed up to work at and dawn was not at her desk she stopped and did a double take where is dawn she is always on time and has never taken a sick day no one else in the office is all that concerned that dawn is not in but natalie cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong when the phone on dawns desk rings natalie answers it and the voice on the other end sounds like dawn and she whispers help me natalie takes it upon herself to drive to dawns house and check on her when she enters dawns house through the unlocked back door natalie is shocked by what she sees dawns living room is covered in blood but dawn is nowhere to be found when the police start their investigation they uncover information that makes them set their sights on natalie natalie is now in a cat and mouse game and she must find out what happened to dawn and why someone is framing heri cannot say too much about what happens because i think it is best to go into this book blind but i will say i wasnt sure who to believe or trust while i was reading at first i liked natalie because she came across as such a nice person every year she has a charity k run event to help raise funds for muscular dystrophy in honor of her friend she lost to the disease natalie also always seemed to go out of her way to be nice to dawn though they were not best friends natalie considered dawn to be a friend but then we get dawns pov via emails she sent to her childhood best friend mia in these emails natalie comes across as a very different person according to dawn natalie was a bully i loved getting these two sides because it made both natalie and dawn unreliable charactersthe coworker was full of so many twists and turns just when i thought i may know what was going on a twist would come and point me in another direction so many times i found my jaw drop and would be like what if you are looking for a twisty psychological thriller then i definitely recommend freida mcfaddens the coworker,positive
the coworker,devious and deadly drama,4,this is the second of mcfaddens books that ive read mcfadden does create significant suspense in this story and i wanted to find out how it would end i figured out a portion of the plot beforehand but was still anxious to see what would happen nextnatalie and dawn are polar opposites natalie is blonde vivacious extroverted and successfulshes a hardcharging sales rep for a bostonbased health supplement company shes wellliked motivated and used to getting what she wantsin contrast dawn is quiet reserved shy and morethanalittle quirky shes rigidly punctual socially awkward and desperately eager to connect with her coworkers often with disastrous results shes a dedicated accountant at the same company as natalie but she exists in the background and on the sidelinesthen one day dawn doesnt show up for workthis wouldnt be particularly unusual for a typical employee but its definitely out of character for dawn whose schedule is consistent and unwavering while out on a sales call natalie impulsively decides to go to dawns home to check on her and to see if anything is amiss natalie enters through an unlocked back door and finds a large bloodstain on the living room carpet shaken she calls the policean investigation begins that centers around dawns various colleagues because she seemed to have few friends and little familythe assigned detective pursues various leads but increasingly circles back to natalie and her possible involvement natalies puzzled and then fearful when she becomes the central focus and primary suspect in the investigation when the battered body of an unidentified woman is foundthe story moves between the search for dawn and natalies racheting alarm at the mounting evidence against her she worries that someone is trying to frame her for murder and watches helplessly as former friends turn against her mcfadden does an excellent job at depicting the juxtaposition of the two womens lives as they intersect and unravel lots of adrenaline and pages turning in a flurry i was surprised by how invested i was given my earlier reaction to mcfaddens other book never lie this one had a slightly more redemptive message though the darker undertones are still everpresent in this book as well mcfadden seems to favor shady characters with sinister edges complicated backstories and subjective motivations as a thriller it works but i wouldnt want to encounter people like this in real life,positive
the coworker,slow burn but worth it,4,so at first it seemed rather pedestrian but still got my attention then the more i read i could make connections between the characters and people i actually work with thats when i knew i was hookedwhile you may get thrown off by parts of the story being told via emails between characters its a plot devise that makes sense once you get through the story similar to the use of newspaper articles and such telling you the story of what happened at the prom in stephen kings carriethats all i will say hereonce again i got caught up in the emotional drama of the main characters that i missed the clues that were right there in front of methis is definitely an easy read but it is engrossing and a fun way to spend the weekend when the weather is crappy and youre having a cup of coffee or chocolate and need a good book to get you through yup its a page turner and a fun rollercoaster ride if you stick with ityou will enjoy the fact that the protagonists are also antagonists and need each other to get out of the mess they created job well done freida,positive
the coworker,if this was an aita post on reddit it would be esh,4,i mean freida does it againan ending that you know is coming because whats a freida book without a twist and yet still shocked i really dont even know how to rate this but because i flew through it in hours its getting starsok so first yea dawn is portrayed as a bit strange lets get that out the waywithout giving spoilers away you will question everyone in this story i thought everyone was delusional at one point and were all having side effects from some supplement from vixedoverall this book is a page turner i dont know how i feel about the end and of course there are questions but overall they both end up having been really sucky peopleif you like freidas writing youll enjoy this one,positive
the coworker,what a spin,5,a definite thriller it had me hooked until the very end natalie and dawn work together dawn seemingly a little weird natalie the top dog at their company vixeduntil one day dawn doesnt show up for work ever so meticulous and methodically predictable natalie is worried about her and goes to their boss to explain that dawn is missing seth their boss doesnt seem too upset and says she will be along shortly not thinking anything is wrong until natalie goes back to her desk and hears dawns phone ringing in her cubicle unaware she picks up the phone to hear a meek help me and the caller hangs up could dawn be in trouble its only then that natalie begins down a dark web of mystery full of lies deceit and even a case of manipulation and possibly murder,positive
the coworker,unreliable fmc make a right,4,frieda mcfadden has done it again this is my second title of hers and i really enjoy the quick easy to read thrillers she puts out the coworker is comprised of two unreliable and rather unlikable fmcs and just enough wtf is going on suspense to make you want to binge read the entire book in one sitting i enjoyed the suspense and plot twists both of which were present throughout the book i consumed this title as both an audio book and ebook the narrator for the audio book was great its a short read so its fast paced by nature overall the coworker is an easy and enjoyable thrilleroverall,positive
the coworker,yes read it autistic character fyi,5,ive been looking forward to reading this story the turtle story lol for a long timei am a huge fan of freida mcfaddens work in general she is a phenomenal wordsmith one of the cream of the crop psychological thriller authors of our day and i honestly think her work is so amazing it will stand the test of time be just as relevant decades into the futurethe coworker is simply one of those books you gobble up most especially to reach the end to learn all the secrets going on between the linesi think its interesting that mcfadden never chose to actually state in any fashion that one of the primary characters is autistic this is big miss in regard to educating the general public about autistic womenpeople but this wasnt a nonfiction book im just disappointed the author never revealed exactly why this person is the way they are other than odd strange weird a target of bullying etcjust a paragraph anywhere would have been great even in her acknowledgments or other personal messages from mcfadden at the end of the storyin any case i absolutely enjoyed this story loved every single one of the characters the plot the exciting conclusionand i actually have a new appreciation for a wealth of random facts about all types of turtles lol,positive
the coworker,gripping,4,hooboy buckle up buttercup because this was a wild ride this was my first freida book and i was not disappointed we all have the coworker that can get under your skin the goody two shoes the over achiever and the slacker none youd actually want to kill though right wrongthe suspense was real in this book i was hooked from the getgo i had to know where dawn was if she was dead and was natalie really capable or was she just a scapegoatthe only thing keeping me from giving this stars was the fact i just couldnt stand dawns long ass emails i mean it helped you understand how quirky she was but every email to mia had me going l not agaaaaainmany thanks to netgalley and poisoned pen press for the advanced reader copy,positive

percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,a good reminder,5,this is a fun continuation of the beloved series i was a little thrown off when i saw this was a th book in the original lighting thief series i had not really been paying attention as i had originals read these books with my daughter it was not on the top of list of things to pay attention to my daughter who counted herself a daughter of apollo lived an breathed this story when she was in grade school i have so many wonderful memories of sitting and talking with her going over the adventures and how she would feel in the various situations as my daughter is now and i often miss her being young this book is an amazing reminder to embrace all stages of life i look forward to reading the last books feeling nostalgia for the time past and approaching the future as an adventure,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,childhood throwback,5,this book brought me back to a time when things were a little easier and i was first dipping my toes into actually reading novels instead of flipping through picture booksi wont give too much away but as i was reading through some pages i realized that a lot of the scenes in the book were vaguely familiar it didnt take me long to realize that this book resembled the first percy jackson bookthe lightning thiefdont get me wrong its a different book entirely and it stands on its own pretty well but it definitely has a similar spark to the first one as i was reading through it i felt like a kid again cracking open the first book after getting my hands on the whole set from a scholastic book fair catalog order i had placed with my literature teacherwith that said i couldnt put the book down it was a quick read but delightful nonetheless i highly recommend to anyone in the mood for something light and fictional or a percy jackson fan wanting to add another classic greek myth to their collection,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,fonts,5,the story is as charming as a regular reader of riordan has come to expect if youre not a regular reader why not there is less action than usual but the snarky asides from the narrator the ever reliable percy jackson are definitely present full humour quotient in placebut what the hell is up with the changing fonts every few words from serif to nonserif and back and forth again and again there are few things as annoying in a novel than anomalies that pull the reader out of the story and this font switching is high on the annoyance list if these were to stress some words as seems to be the case in some instances why not use italics in the common manner this font thing is unacceptableor is this a problem in the formatting when uploading the digital version if thats the issue for the sake of all the gods fix it and fix it now then arrange for a corrected version to be downloaded to every person who spent actual money for this you cant treat loyal fans this waycheers,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,nostalgia and a nice warm olympian blanket,5,spoiler free review i enjoyed every page this book was completely full of classic riordancharm and brought me right back to when i first opened the lightning thiefin this book percy reflects on what his life might look like beyond the dangers of being a teenage demigod and in this offers us readers a chance to reflect on who we were when we first discovered pjo and who we are becoming today riordan navigated this parallel with brilliant easemy only sticking point is it did not feel like an ending to a two decade adventureit feels like the first book of a new trilogy and being only pages it was significantly shorter than most of the books in this universe so i finished the book happy but ultimately craving more,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,welcome back to the world of percy jackson,5,i love percy jackson i read the original series growing up and this book felt like a blast from the past it gets back to the original series roots with punny jokes and percy being percy we see a return to the sarcastic and lovable percy from the original seriesmy only issue with the book was that it felt kinda rushed and i wouldve loved to see more of the scenes expanded on it was shorter than the other books and was definitely a return to less dark material especially considering heroes of olympus had percyannabeth fighting for their lives in tartarus this was a return to the light and levity that is rick riordan has me wanting to reread all the books over again,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,low stakes adventure,5,loved this book it was so nice to get back into percys head after so long and revisit the lovely relationship between the core trio this is not the most high stakes dramatic book in ricks catalogue but its just cozy and nostalgic and fun questing for recommendation letters is a much chiller end goal than the series usual saving the world fare but had moments of legitimate tension too highly recommend for readers of the original series,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,loved it,5,what a treat a new pjo book without a big end of the world threat its perfect theres a quest but its less stressful than the past ones you get to see the original trio and percy balancing his quest with his daily life for oncethe quest was still thrilling and the humour was on point as alwaysi loved it,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,blast from the past,5,this is so good ive only read the first chapters but they are amusing and start off with that classic look i didnt want to be line im and this is still a book i can enjoy freely and openly with my friends i know it may seem a little immature for someone my age but the stories become more mature and dark as you read each book the sarcasm and humor still stay but the books become more descriptive with the battles and carnage this was a welcome change no saving the world just percy being percy and by that i mean being a total idiot and getting him and his incredibly bad luck in every bad situation possible,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,the quest for college,4,percy learns that he needs to get letters of recommendation from gods for his acceptance to new rome university with annabeth but its not that simple he needs to do quests to earn them this is the story of his first quest i didnt think that the story was quite as good as the previous books but it wasnt bad either it felt like it was written down to a younger age level than the other books also riordans switching from serif to nonserif fonts instead of using italics was both odd and annoying it tended to cause a break in concentration,positive
percy jackson and the olympians the chalice of the gods percy jackson the olympians,perfect for old and new fans,5,percy jackson and the olympians is my favorite book series of all time and chalice of the gods did not disappoint i am extra excited for the next one everyone should be reading this,positive

hatchet,urgent and realistic survival novel,5,brian was on the way to visit his father in the oil fields of canada after his parents recent divorce but midflight the pilot of the small cessna had a heart attack and died leaving brian alone in a plane flying hundreds of miles off course the plane finally crashed in a remote canadian lake leaving brian stranded with nothing but a small hatchet and the clothes on his back this is a story of survival and determinationwhat i liked the author had experienced many of the same things that brian experienced in the book so he was able to write with a realism and urgency not seen in a book like my side of the mountain it was a bit more grotesque than i expectedwhat i didnt like i feel like the book wouldnt have suffered if paulsen had omitted the tornado scene it felt a little forced to me,positive

hatchet,wisdom in the wilderness,5,i read hatchet for the first time many years ago probably when it became a newbery honor book not all newbery books are great but this one was being reminded of it recently i noticed that it is the first book of a series of five most of which i have never read so i decided to go back to ithatchet is the story of thirteenyearold brian robeson brian sets off as a passenger in a singleengine bush plane to visit his father in northern canada on the way the pilot dies in a heart attack brian whom the pilot had been showing how to fly the plane before his heart attack manages to crash the plane in a lake in the forest he survives the crash but then has the problem of surviving until he is rescued he does survive not a spoiler since the publishers blurb tells us that this is a story of survivalyou would naturally imagine this to be an actionpacked story but it really is not there are a few exciting moments most conspicuously the crash and the tornado also mentioned in the blurb it is mostly about brian figuring out how to survive how to feed himself and remain safe from danger and survival it turns out depends on wisdom brian learns to see the wild world he inhabits and to know its meanings i am tempted to say that brian becomes wise but i think thats unfair to him brian was wise but his wisdom needed to be brought to the forein an epilog gary paulsen tells us that brian is forever changed by this experiencewhen the pilot rescued brian he had been alone on the lshaped lake for fiftyfour days during that time he had lost seventeen percent of his body weight he later gained back six percent but had virtually no body fathis body had consumed all extra weight and he would remain lean and wiry for several yearsmany of the changes would prove to be permanent brian had gained immensely in his ability to observe what was happening and react to it that would last him all his life he had become more thoughtful as well and from that time on he would think slowly about something before speakingwhen i read that i felt oddly envious i caught myself wishing that something like this could happen to me of course i dont really i dont want to be trapped in the forests of northern ontario for weeks all on my own im happy here with my books and movies and grocery stores and microwave oven but let us just say hatchet shows me something of what those cost mehatchet is brief about a twohour read and yes there is indeed a hatchet involved the story has a real feeling of authenticity,positive

the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,an extraordinary tale,5,as a tale gets passed from one person to another it ripples out until it is as wide and mythic as the seathe annals of british naval history abound with great and small adventures alike none however captivates like the extraordinary tale of the hms wager and no one can better recount such a hairraising series of events than david grann with the wager grann tops his previous works of narrative nonfiction with this harrowing story of inconceivable hardship and the machinations of desperate men to be sure no incident contained in this book is without ample evidence proving it occurredit is hard to imagine a more horrifying set of survival conditions than those faced by wagers crew and capturing those conditions accurately based on aging historical records and biased published accounts was undoubtedly tricky yet grann does yeomans work on this story of the illfated wager part of a british squadron ordered to sea in august against the spanish in the apocryphal war of jenkins ear commanding wager and at the center of granns book is captain david cheap a deeply flawed and complicated skipperlike granns other books the wager nearly requires one to suspend disbelief the author carefully and patiently reveals the storys events shocking the reader in the process moreover upon completing granns page account of wagers exploits and those of its sister ship hms centurion the reader better understands the ruthlessness and cunning demonstrated by the british royal navy as it navigated the high seas in quest of empire indeed british imperial ambitions are fully displayed in the wagerbased mainly on seamens logbooks and trial records many of which are over years old grann pieces together the seemingly doomed wagers calamities while providing ample historical context the author for example details the multitudinous threats facing british ships as they pursued the empires aims in the midth century he also describes shipboard conditions on a british manofwar sailing the worlds oceans during this erawager meets its fate while searching for a spanish galleon laden with treasure and attempting to negotiate the treacherous seas off cape horn at the tip of the south american continent the crew already decimated by storms scurvy and sundry other trials finds its ship dashed on the rocks off the coast of patagonia argentina marooned in may with little hope of rescue the men struggle to survive on a scabrous spit of land subsequently named wager islandmalnourished and desperate wagers surviving company suffers a complete breakdown in discipline and decorum having lost confidence in the ailing and unpredictable cheap still in command the castaways defy british naval law and flout regulations a fulminant cheap for his part opposes the indiscipline and enforces his authority at the end of a pistol a mutiny takes shape and eventually a breakaway faction led by gunners mate john bulkeley abandons cheap and his loyalists leaving them to fend for themselves on wager island by this time subsisting on the meagerest of diets harvested from terrain that barely sustains life while withstanding storm after storm cheap and crew somehow enduresailing a small transport boat reinforced with scrap lumber harvested from wager and equipped with makeshift sails and rigging bulkeley and his charges successfully navigate the strait of magellan to brazil meanwhile cheap and the wager island stragglers experience an equally implausible outcome sailing on an eighteenfoot yawl salvaged from the wager they set off to reach the chilean coast surviving their respective ordeals the two parties return to london providing their lurid accounts of mutiny betrayal abandonment and murder to an incredulous british admiralty and fascinated public they alternately face scorn and approbation and eventually courtmartialit is the wager leaderships trial for which grann saves his best narration and jawdropping surprise endingthe wager asks which of the stories is harder to believe the deathdefying travails and travels of these indomitable seamen or the unanticipated result as the british admiralty adjudicates their fate yet grann provides the reader with all the evidence necessary to confirm these events happened irrefutably relying on an abundance of journals logs diaries and even letters grann demonstrates again his seemingly unquenchable thirst for the truth to inform his audience his singlespaced bibliography alone exceeds pageswithout question the wager is an astonishing naval story reminiscent of charles nordhoffs and james norman halls mutiny on the bounty considering the inglorious actions of the wagers crew granns book is worth reading and rereading to comprehend the motives of desperate men experiencing the audacity and might of the th century british royal navy particularly exemplified by centurion as she squares off with the spanish manofwar our lady of covadonga off the philippines provides immensely satisfying adventure reading granns spellbinding account of the naval gunfight puts the reader in the crows nest as though he is viewing the fight aboard the centurion from the very mast topthe wager offers an incredible piece of storytelling suitable for any devotee of narrative nonfiction or lover of naval lorean extraordinary tale,positive
the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,david grann wrote a bigdog book,5,i absolutely loved the wager as my headline suggests i consider this to be a bigdog book what constitutes a bigdog book it has to be the right combination of information amusement and never being able to put it down david grann did all three at a very high level i think i love this guy david grann he must have worked so damn hard on this book the amount of scribbles and scrabbles he was probably trying to decipher from these dumb year old ship logs it must have been so tediousbut grann did it he went to work and researched the tits out of this story and sure there are certainly holes he must have approached in the story and realized that he would have to creatively fill those in that in my opinion is to be expected not only did grann fill those holes he did it expertly and seamlessly do you know why we have the phrase sheets to the wind as a euphemism for being drunk well throughout this history of the british manowars david grann teaches you that theres more to being a shipman than knowing a few knots phrases it takes guts and sometimes even honori wont spoil the story for you here i believe the amazon description above gives you even too much information and spoils as the kids say speaking of kids my year old son was watching me devour this book he was the only one in my family willing to listen to the new things id learned about manowars or ancient tribes while we all gathered at the dinner table did you know that the british navy could just roll up on homies who had abandoned their ships and pretended to be dead so they didnt have to go back to sea they called these guys press gangs only my year old would chirp up and say something positive like thats awesome dad or do you think you could be a seaman dad what a nice boyone day while i was cranking through the part of the book near the end that is sort of the political intrigue portion my son said david grannwhat i askeddavid grann the author my son was staring at the book jacket cover i bet hes a real gi motioned for the kid to come over and when he sat next to me i said a g you better believe grann is a g because he did all this freakin research to make this book come to life if thats not bein a g then i dont know what else is plus take a look at this picture of him inside the book jackethe leaned in and looked at this picture of the most glookin dude of all time david grann standing there with a polo shirt and jacket on top not really smiling not really frowning just a look of a confident son of a bitch my son was right grann is a real g we looked at the picture and then my son read the little bio below which is just his bonafides in the literary sense we would have preferred david give us a little bit more personal stuff for example his favorite pizza topping would be a good choice to include what about his favorite books instead of a list of books he wrote i get it his publisher only wants to pimp his books instead of other authors still give me a little flavor with grannunder his bio there is his social media and website listed only his twitter and facebook handle no instagram i found that strange youd think thered be a wager instagram handle at least when i finished the book i wanted to shout it out on my instagram story and let everyone know that david grann is a g and he wrote a bigdog book to my surprise i found that grann did have an instagram page i was shocked did one of his kids shame him into doing this his publisher maybe regardless my dude only has like or posts and its just pictures of the hardcopy of the wager stacked on top of each other i tagged this sad instagram account to my hype story about the book anyway i thought it couldnt do harmi recommend this book mightily if you couldnt tell,positive
the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,granns gift as a storyteller on full display,5,granns gift as a storyteller on full displayin the first half of the th century britain already had the most powerful navy in the world but financing that navy was a huge burden on the crown and england had not yet achieved the wealth that the industrial revolution and its own colonization efforts would later bring the answer intercept the gold and silver that spanish ships were bringing home from its new world coloniesauthor david grann is able to tell not only this larger story but also to resurrect one of the most astonishing seafaring events of the time a ship named the wager was to be part of a british fleet that would intercept goldladen spanish vessels in what was officiallysanctioned piracy as the books cover indicates what then transpired was shipwreck mutiny and murder this is also the story of unexpected survival and efforts in an admiralty court back in england to establish the truth of what happenedlife on board a ship at the time so full of danger and disease that it was not unusual for as few as ten percent of the crew to survive a long voyage meant that the royal navy had great difficulty manning its ships grann provides graphic descriptions of ablebodied and notsoablebodied men being kidnapped off the wharfs impressed to fill the complement of seamen just as a ship was about to sail some years later the impressment of american seamen was a contributor to the war of the hulls of wooden sailing ships had a very short lifespan due to woodeating worms and were susceptible to leaks and other threats to seaworthiness scurvy could render entire crews incapable of functioning other communicable diseases could cause widespread death on board a crowded illventilated vesselin the case of the wager the author was able to find a remarkable record of its voyage and of the events to come this was in part due to the fact that on board as a junior officer was john byron a gentleman volunteer and a compulsive diarist incidentally he was the grandfather of lord byronadditionally another major actor in the drama john bulkeley had kept a voluminous diary which chronicled the events of the voyage buikeley held the position of gunner a crucial role in ship combat and had many other responsibilities on board he was an instinctive leader physically imposing who commanded respectfinally there was the record of the courtmartial proceedings themselves in which the main actors including david cheap the captain provided their own version of events cheap was an ambitious younger son of a scottish laird who under the rules of primogeniture did not inherit his fathers estate he ran off to sea at and set his sights on becoming a captain which he realized when an opening occurred on the wagerthe wager survived the perilous passage around the treacherous cape horn only to run aground and break up on the rocks of an uninhabited island off patagonia there were no animals or other significant source of food on the island the crew soon divided into two factions one supporting captain cheap who wanted to build a vessel out of timbers salvaged from the shipwreck and continue up the pacific coast of south america to engage spanish ships the other group was led by buckeley who wanted to build a vessel to return to england the situation was so dire it would seem impossible that either group would surviveimprobably a few men did make their way back to england to be hailed as heroes that is until a second group including captain cheap also arrived this forms the final chapter of the story of the wager and the launch of an inquiry to establish the truthfaced by death by hanging if they were found guilty of mutiny or of discipline if they failed their duty each survivor told his story members of the admiralty found themselves confounded by competing versions of events the author tells us the result was unexpected but only if one fails to consider that the leaders of an institution in this case the royal navy have as their first priority the preservation of that institution and the protection of its reputationthis is a wonderfullywritten book and grann is a masterful story teller,positive
the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,astonishing tale of castaways battling the elements starvation and ultimately each other,4,im a fan of books about the age of sail either fiction or nonfiction and the wager was an easy title to choose given the subject matter in a royal navy squadron sets off on a secret mission to track down and capture a treasure laden spanish galleon while attempting to navigate the treacherous cape horn passage the hms wager is wrecked in severe weather off a desolate island on the patagonian coast what ensues is an astonishing tale of the marooned crew battling the harsh elements starvation and ultimately each other remarkably some of them survive and return to england with conflicting accounts of exactly happened to the illfated crew of the wager you have to admire the courage tenacity grit and perseverance of individuals confronting such extreme adversity even the basic act of going to sea back then for months or years at a time required someone with exceptional intestinal fortitude the skills and knowledge needed in those days to maneuver and navigate these complex sailing ships was considerable while bringing them into battle and defeating the enemy meant having a leader of incredible ability and luck david granns telling of the fate of the wager and her crew is masterfully done and hard to put down the author meticulously researched this book and the amount of care he put into this work is obvious for those who dont think they like reading history books id suggest trying the wager because once you get sucked into the narrative youll be turning the pages to find out what happens next to these unfortunate castaways im not sure what to make about some of the negative reviews i read here about the lack of dialogthis isnt a novel and there arent any actual recordings of conversations that could be included its like complaining that there arent any photos in the bible as a side note visiting an actual sailing ship of the era is an educational experience the uss constitution in boston or the whaler charles w morgan in mystic connecticut gives you an idea of the conditions sailors like the ones on hms wager had to live with if in the uk then a trip to portsmouth where our story begins is highly recommended give yourself a couple of days and tour horatio nelsons flagship hms victory to really get a feel for what a british man of war was like from the th century,positive
the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,thrilling account of a real voyage that reads like a novel,4,the wager was an english ship that set sail from england in during an imperial war with spain it was the mids and navigational tools were primitive diseases among the seafarers spread rapidly and i was incredulous realizing how little they knew about curbing nutritional deficiencies such as scurvy it seems absurd that in addition to not knowing about the necessity for vitamin c insufficient levels of niacin were causing psychosis and night blindness resulting from lack of vitamin a after shipwrecking on a desolate island off the coast of patagonia the story is as much about human nature as it is about surviving on an island and attaining its mission against the spanish it is fascinating to read about how they discovered new food sources and what they chose to learn and ignore from natives whose cultures had thrived in the areas where the englishmen became castaways if they were going to continue to survive and continue their naval mission they had to build new boats without the technology available in their homeland and there were myriad disagreements about how to proceed and also about which path to follow when it was time to embark on the dangerous waters again disharmony leads some groups to set sail in opposite directions eventually when the survivors arrived back in england the accounts of what happened were not in syncthe characters who are historical figures demonstrate the gamut of human emotions and an evolution of social mores without describing each character ill point out that we meet a dominating captain with poor leadership traits and of course we meet argumentative underlings who have smug independence then we see ferocious workers and others with inherent leadership skills and charisma all of the men are familiar with british naval order and ranking conventions yet more hierarchies develop as the men struggle to survive and create social order as the subtitle suggests the fight for survival leads to becoming mutinous and murderous grann describes the basic human drives and terrors with admirable writing skillswriting in the eighteenth century was an honorable thing to do the men onboard the wager kept written logssome were required and others were kept to document some of the mutinous decisions david grann had copious notes and records to use when piecing this story together rousseau and voltaire cited the wagers expedition reports as did charles darwin and herman melville the seafaring journalists quote the bible poets and famous writers it is incredible how learned they were grann uses his wellhoned investigative and research skills to weave a beautiful story of what reportedly happened and the eloquent analysis by those who experienced it granns ability to combine firstperson accounts of the expedition with his summation of the events provides fabulous text about the seafarers and their exploits each creative descriptive section title structures the book and shapes the voyage with metaphoric summaries the wooden world into the storm castaways deliverance and judgment are the main sections and gran used these to develop the book so that it reads like a novel and keeps the reader riveted i highly recommend this narrative to everyone even those who prefer fiction to nonfiction,positive
the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,a comment on the notes in the kindle version,5,first of all great book if you like eric larson you will certainly like david grann well researched history wedded with the heart of a story teller nothing dry and dusty here other people have elaborated the merits so now for my main issue some people prefer to read without the interruption of footnotes some like to consider the additional information as they read i am in this later category and my comment is for those who feel likewise in formatting this book for kindle the publisher does not use numbered notations accessible in the main body of the text when a reader has finished the last chapter if choosing to page through what follows there are additional treasures among these the notes supposing the reader scans through these and finds something of interest one can link back to the text and then back to the notes but there is no way to come upon the notes while reading the main text i guess i just like a little more foot in my notes thank you very much i dont believe its too obtrusive to have that little number woven into things readers who dont care for the diversion can just glide by so whats the deal sighok one other noteworthy hehehe item i read this on a fire tablet and on a paperwhite and in the paperwhite the pagination ended with the main text and book complete appeared instead im not a fan of this i get that some folks want credit for finishing a book without the hassle of paging through a host of addendums but really must the rest of us do without gaaaah,positive

the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,a s sailing tale about survival,5,have been reading sailing stories and this book came up with an excellent research job and studies of the journals kept the wager set sail from england in search of spanish ships with which to do battle but in those early times that meant sailing around the cape at the tip of south america not an easy task and definitely not in those times and it all goes wrong with the inhabitants of the ship suffering from scurvy affecting their vision and many other ailments after hitting an island that barely qualifies as land with no real resources from which to feed the story really begins on survival and fighting amongst the crew amazingly they generally survive and attempt to sail away but not together and this is the story to read that i cannot sharewho will be blamed who was to blame what are the consequences how many survive all great questions and well worth the read to finish the story,positive
the wager a tale of shipwreck mutiny and murder,very good narrative nonfiction,4,i really liked this work of narrative nonfiction every character in this true story is flawed and acts badly under extreme stress people will do very bad things when struggling to survive in dire conditions the practices in the th century british navy vs what you would see today were barbaric i read this on my kindle fire and there were no notes in the text i also wondered as the story seemed to be winding down how could i only be through this book it turns out notes pictures etc took up half the length on kindle this book is extremely well researched as it turns out although it was slow to get going by the middle i was looking forward to reading every day after work the authors writing style is very accessible the characters are also very well drawn out it was kind of confusing in the beginning when men were changing ships and the various captains in reading nonfiction often the denseness of the prose just becomes boring not so here the story is very compelling i was disappointed when it ended sooner that expected,positive
