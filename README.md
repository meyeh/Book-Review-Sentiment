2025 Machine Learning Project

The 3 machine learning models are CNN, RNN, and LSTM.  
Download the corresponding datasets: processed_df1, processed_df2, processed_df3.    
Download the jupyter notebook files: CNNmodel, RNNmodel, LSTMmodel. Each file contains the imports, csv files, the specific machine learning model, and experimentation.      
Change the pandas import cvs lines in each file to the file path on your device.  
Import/Download the corresponding imports and libraries for each file to ensure the code can run.  
I recommend using anaconda navigator and creating an environment where you can download all the necessary packages.
